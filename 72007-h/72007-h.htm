<hr class="r5">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>


<p>June 22, 1807, while Jefferson at Washington was
fuming over Chief-Justice Marshall’s subpœna, and
while the grand jury at Richmond were on the point
of finding their indictment against Burr, an event
occurred at sea, off the entrance to Chesapeake Bay,
which threw the country into violent excitement, distracting
attention from Burr, and putting to a supreme
test the theories of Jefferson’s statesmanship.</p>

<p>That the accident which then happened should not
have happened long before was matter for wonder,
considering the arbitrary character of British naval
officers and their small regard for neutral rights. For
many years the open encouragement offered to the
desertion of British seamen in American ports had
caused extreme annoyance to the royal navy; and
nowhere had this trouble been more serious than at
Norfolk. Early in 1807 a British squadron happened
to be lying within the Capes watching for some
French frigates which had taken refuge at Annapolis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
One or more of these British ships lay occasionally in
Hampton Roads, or came to the navy-yard at Gosport
for necessary repairs. Desertions were of course
numerous; even the American ships-of-war had much
difficulty from loss of men,—and March 7 a whole
boat’s crew of the British sixteen-gun sloop “Halifax”
made off with the jolly-boat and escaped to Norfolk.
The commander of the “Halifax” was informed that
these men had enlisted in the American frigate
“Chesapeake,” then under orders for the Mediterranean.
He complained to the British consul and to
Captain Decatur, but could get no redress. He met
two of the deserters in the streets of Norfolk, and
asked them why they did not return. One of them,
Jenkin Ratford by name, replied, with abuse and oaths,
that he was in the land of liberty and would do as he
liked. The British minister at Washington also made
complaint that three deserters from the “Melampus”
frigate had enlisted on the “Chesapeake.” The Secretary
of the Navy ordered an inquiry, which proved
that the three men in question, one of whom was a
negro, were in fact on board the “Chesapeake,” but
that they were native Americans who had been improperly
impressed by the “Melampus,” and therefore
were not subjects for reclamation by the British government.
The nationality was admitted, and so far as
these men were concerned the answer was final; but
the presence of Jenkin Ratford, an Englishman, on
board the “Chesapeake” under the name of Wilson
escaped notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>The admiral in command of the British ships on the
North American station was George Cranfield Berkeley,
a brother of the Earl of Berkeley. To him, at Halifax,
the British officers in Chesapeake Bay reported their
grievances; and Admiral Berkeley, without waiting for
authority from England, issued the following orders,
addressed to all the ships under his command:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas many seamen, subjects of his Britannic
Majesty, and serving in his ships and vessels as per margin
[“Bellona,” “Belleisle,” “Triumph,” “Chichester,”
“Halifax,” “Zenobia”], while at anchor in the Chesapeake,
deserted and entered on board the United States
frigate called the ‘Chesapeake,’ and openly paraded the
streets of Norfolk, in sight of their officers, under the
American flag, protected by the magistrates of the town
and the recruiting officer belonging to the above-mentioned
American frigate, which magistrates and naval officer refused
giving them up, although demanded by his Britannic
Majesty’s consul, as well as the captains of the ships
from which the said men had deserted:</p>

<p>“The captains and commanders of his Majesty’s ships
and vessels under my command are therefore hereby required
and directed, in case of meeting with the American
frigate ‘Chesapeake’ at sea, and without the limits of the
United States, to show to the captain of her this order,
and to require to search his ship for the deserters from
the before-mentioned ships, and to proceed and search
for the same; and if a similar demand should be made
by the American, he is to be permitted to search for any
deserters from their service, according to the customs and
usage of civilized nations on terms of peace and amity
with each other.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The admiral’s conception of the “customs and usage
of civilized nations” did not expressly require the use
of force; and any captain or commander who received
this circular must at once have asked whether, in
case the American captain should refuse to allow a
search,—as was certain,—force should be employed.
The order, dated June 1, 1807, was sent to Chesapeake
Bay by the frigate “Leopard,” commanded by
Captain S. P. Humphreys; and since the “Leopard”
was the admiral’s flagship, Captain Humphreys was
probably acquainted with the meaning of his instructions.
The “Leopard” arrived at Lynnhaven
on the morning of June 21; and Captain Humphreys
reported his arrival and orders to Captain John
Erskine Douglas of the “Bellona,” a line-of-battle
ship, then lying with the “Melampus” frigate in
Lynnhaven Bay, enjoying the hospitality of the American
government. Apparently Captain Douglas carried
verbal explanations of the order from Captain
Humphreys, for he made no attempt to qualify its
extremest meaning. The “Leopard” remained
twenty-four hours with the “Bellona,” while the
two commanders were in consultation. The next
morning, June 22, at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the “Leopard” made
sail,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and two hours later re-anchored a few miles to
the eastward, and about three miles north of Cape
Henry Lighthouse.</p>

<p>The “Chesapeake,” during the difficulties at Norfolk
and afterward, lay in the Eastern Branch at Washington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
The inefficiency of the Government in doing
those duties which governments had hitherto been
created to perform, was shown even more strikingly
in the story of the “Chesapeake” than in the conspiracy
of Burr. The frigate “Constitution” had
sailed for the Mediterranean in August, 1803. The
Government knew that her crew were entitled to
their discharge, and that the President had no right
to withhold it. The country was at peace; no emergency
of any kind existed. A single ship of about
one thousand tons burden needed to be fitted for
sea at a date fixed three years beforehand; yet when
the time came and the “Constitution” ought to
have reached home, the “Chesapeake” had not so
much as begun preparation. Captain James Barron
was selected to command her as commodore of the
Mediterranean squadron; Captain Charles Gordon—a
native of the eastern shore of Maryland, the youngest
master-commandant on the list—was appointed as
her captain. Both were good officers and seamen;
but Gordon received his orders only February 22,
and could not take command until May 1,—long
after he should have reached Gibraltar. Such was
the inefficiency of the navy-yard at Washington that
although the Secretary of the Navy had the “Chesapeake”
under his eye and was most anxious to fit her
out, and although Gordon fretted incessantly, making
bitter complaints of delay, the frigate still remained
in the mechanics’ hands until the month of May.
According to Commodore Barron the Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
navy-yard was more than incompetent.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “I have
long known,” he claimed to have written, “the perverse
disposition of the rulers of that establishment.”
Yet he urged Gordon to complete his outfit at Washington,
because the Norfolk yard was worse.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “I
would by no means advise your leaving the navy-yard
with any unfinished work and depend on Norfolk.
You will experience more difficulty and trouble
than you can imagine.” As Burr’s trial showed that
the army was honeycombed by incompetence and
conspiracy, so Barron’s court-martial proved that
nothing in naval administration could be depended
upon.</p>

<p>For much of this, Congress and the people were
responsible, and they accepted their own feebleness as
the necessary consequence of a system which acted
through other agencies than force; but much was also
due to the Administration and to the President’s instincts,
which held him aloof from direct contact with
both services. Jefferson did not love the deck of a
man-of-war or enjoy the sound of a boatswain’s whistle.
The ocean was not his element; and his appetite
for knowledge never led him to criticise the management
of his frigates or his regiments so long as
he could shut his eyes to their shortcomings. Thus
while Wilkinson was left at his own pleasure to
create or to stifle a rebellion at New Orleans, the
crew of the “Constitution” were in a state of mutiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
in the Mediterranean, and the officers of the “Chesapeake”
were helpless under the control of the navy-yard
at Washington.</p>

<p>At length, in the earliest days of June, Gordon
dropped down the Potomac. The “Chesapeake” was
to carry on this cruise an armament of forty guns,—twenty-eight
18-pounders and twelve 32-pound carronades;
but owing to the shoals in the river she took
but twelve guns on board at Washington, the rest
waiting her arrival at Norfolk. With these twelve
guns Gordon tried to fire the customary salute in
passing Mount Vernon; and he wrote to the secretary
in exasperation at the result of this first
experience:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Had we been engaged in an active war I should suspect
the officers of the yard with having a design on my
character; but fortunately Mount Vernon drew our attention
to the guns before we could apprehend any danger
from an enemy. In the act of saluting that place I
was struck with astonishment when the first lieutenant
reported to me that neither the sponges nor cartridges
would go in the guns. I immediately arrested my gunner;
but on his satisfying me that he had received them
from the gunner of the yard I released him, and hold Mr.
Stevenson responsible.”</p>
</div>

<p>The mistakes were easily corrected, and the ship
arrived in Hampton Roads without further incident.
Commodore Barron, who first came aboard June 6,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
wrote<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at once to the secretary, “that from the extreme
cleanliness and order in which I found her I
am convinced that Captain Gordon and his officers
must have used great exertions. Captain Gordon
speaks in high terms of his lieutenants. The state
of the ship proves the justice of his encomiums.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless much remained to be done, and in
spite of the secretary’s urgency the ship was still delayed
in Hampton Roads. From June 6 to June 19,
notwithstanding bad weather, the whole ship’s company
were hard worked. The guns were taken on
board and fitted; water was got in; spars and rigging
had to be overhauled, and stores for four hundred
men on a three-years cruise were shipped. June 19
the guns were all fitted, and the crew could for the
first time be assigned to their stations at quarters.
According to the custom of the service, the guns
were charged with powder and shot. They had no
locks, and were fired by the old-fashioned slow-match,
or by loggerheads kept in the magazine and heated
red-hot in the galley fire whenever need for them
arose.</p>

<p>June 19 Captain Gordon considered the ship ready
for sea, and wrote to the commodore on shore,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “We
are unmoored and ready for weighing the first fair
wind.” Both Captain Gordon and Commodore Barron
were aware that the decks were more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
encumbered, and that the crew had not been exercised
at the guns; but they were not warranted in
detaining her on that account, especially since the
guns could be better exercised at sea, and the ship
was already four months behind time. Accordingly,
June 21, Commodore Barron came on board, and at
four o’clock in the afternoon the “Chesapeake”
weighed anchor and stood down the Roads; at six
o’clock she came to, dropped anchor, called all hands
to quarters, and prepared to start for sea the next
morning. From Lynnhaven Bay the “Leopard,”
which had arrived from Halifax only a few hours
before, could watch every movement of the American
frigate.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past seven o’clock on the morning of
June 22 the “Chesapeake” got under way with a fair
breeze. Her ship’s company numbered three hundred
and seventy-five men and boys, all told, but, as
was not uncommon in leaving port, much sickness
prevailed among the crew, and by the doctor’s order
the sick seamen were allowed to lie in the sun and
air on the upper deck. The gun-deck between the
guns was encumbered with lumber of one sort or
another; the cables were not yet stowed away; four
of the guns did not fit quite perfectly to their carriages,
and needed a few blows with a maul to drive
the trunnions home, but this defect escaped the eye;
in the magazine the gunner had reported the powder-horns,
used in priming the guns, as filled, whereas
only five were in fact filled. Otherwise the ship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
except for the freshness of her crew, was in fair
condition.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, passing Lynnhaven Bay, the officers
on deck noticed the “Bellona” and “Melampus” at
anchor. The “Leopard” lay farther out, and the
“Bellona” was observed to be signalling. A story
had been circulated at Norfolk that the captain of the
“Melampus” threatened to take his deserters out of
the “Chesapeake;” but rumors of this sort roused
so little attention that no one on board the American
frigate gave special notice to the British squadron.
The “Melampus” lay quietly at anchor. Had Barron
been able to read the “Bellona’s” signals he would
have suspected nothing, for they contained merely an
order to the “Leopard” to weigh and reconnoitre in
the southeast by east.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The British squadron was
in the habit of keeping a cruiser outside to overhaul
merchant-vessels; and when the “Leopard” stood
out to sea, the officers of the “Chesapeake” naturally
supposed that this was her errand.</p>

<p>At noon Cape Henry bore southwest by south, distant
one or two miles. The day was fine; but the
breeze then shifted to the south-southeast, and began
to blow fresh. The change of wind brought the
“Leopard” to windward. At about a quarter-past
two the “Chesapeake” tacked in shore to wait for
the pilot-boat which was to take off the pilot. The
“Leopard” tacked also, about a mile distant. At
the same time dinner was served at the commodore’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
table, and Barron, Gordon, Captain Hall of the marines,
Dr. Bullus and his wife sat down to it. Captain
Gordon afterward testified that as they were
dining Commodore Barron noticed the British frigate
through the larboard forward port of the cabin, and
made the remark “that her movements appeared suspicious,
but she could have nothing to do with us.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Barron positively denied ever having made the remark;
but whether he said it or not, nothing more
than a passing doubt occurred to him or to any other
person on board. Gordon returned to his work; the
crew began to stow away the cable; and at a quarter
before three o’clock, the pilot-boat nearing, the
“Chesapeake” again stood out to sea, the “Leopard”
immediately following her tack.</p>

<p>At about half-past three o’clock, both ships being
eight or ten miles southeast by east of Cape Henry,
the “Leopard” came down before the wind, and
rounding to, about half a cable’s length to windward,
hailed, and said she had despatches for the commodore.
Barron returned the hail and replied, “We
will heave to and you can send your boat on board
of us.” British ships-of-war on distant stations not
infrequently sent despatches by the courtesy of American
officers, and such a request implied no hostile
purpose. British ships also arrogated a sort of right
to the windward; and the “Leopard’s” manœuvre,
although one which no commander except an Englishman
would naturally have made, roused no peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
attention. The “Leopard’s” ports were seen to
be triced up; but the season was midsummer, the
weather was fine and warm, and the frigate was in
sight of her anchorage. Doubtless Barron ought not
to have allowed a foreign ship-of-war to come alongside
without calling his crew to quarters,—such was
the general rule of the service; but the condition of
the ship made it inconvenient to clear the guns, and
the idea of an attack was so extravagant that, as
Barron afterward said, he might as well have expected
one when at anchor in Hampton Roads. After the
event several officers, including Captain Gordon, affirmed
that they felt suspicions; but they showed none
at the time, and neither Gordon nor any one else suggested,
either to the commodore or to each other, that
it would be well to order the crew to quarters.</p>

<p>Barron went to his cabin to receive the British officer,
whose boat came alongside. At a quarter before
four o’clock Lieutenant Meade from the “Leopard”
arrived on board, and was shown by Captain Gordon
to the commodore’s cabin. He delivered the following
note:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The captain of his Britannic Majesty’s ship ‘Leopard’
has the honor to enclose the captain of the United
States ship ‘Chesapeake’ an order from the Honorable
Vice-Admiral Berkeley, commander-in-chief of his
Majesty’s ships on the North American station, respecting
some deserters from the ships (therein mentioned)
under his command, and supposed to be now serving as
part of the crew of the ‘Chesapeake.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“The captain of the ‘Leopard’ will not presume to
say anything in addition to what the commander-in-chief
has stated, more than to express a hope that every circumstance
respecting them may be adjusted in a manner
that the harmony subsisting between the two countries
may remain undisturbed.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having read Captain Humphrey’s note, Commodore
Barron took up the enclosed order signed by Admiral
Berkeley. This order, as the note mentioned, designated
deserters from certain ships. Barron knew that
he had on board three deserters from the “Melampus,”
and that these three men had been the only
deserters officially and regularly demanded by the
British minister. His first thought was to look for
the “Melampus” in the admiral’s list; and on seeing
that Berkeley had omitted it, Barron inferred that his
own assurance would satisfy Captain Humphreys, and
that the demand of search, being meant as a mere
formality, would not be pressed. He explained to
the British lieutenant the circumstances relating to
the three men from the “Melampus,” and after some
consultation with Dr. Bullus, who was going out as
consul to the Mediterranean, he wrote to Captain
Humphreys the following reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know of no such men as you describe. The officers
that were on the recruiting service for this ship were particularly
instructed by the Government, through me, not
to enter any deserters from his Britannic Majesty’s ships,
nor do I know of any being here. I am also instructed
never to permit the crew of any ship that I command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
to be mustered by any other but their own officers. It
is my disposition to preserve harmony, and I hope this
answer to your despatch will prove satisfactory.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such an answer to such a demand was little suited
to check the energy of a British officer in carrying
out his positive orders. If Barron had wished to
invite an attack, he could have done nothing more
to the purpose than by receiving Berkeley’s orders
without a movement of self-defence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at a quarter-past four the officer of the
deck sent down word that the British frigate had a
signal flying. The lieutenant understood it for a signal
of recall, as he had been half an hour away, and
as soon as the letter could be written he hurried with
it to his boat. No sooner had he left the cabin than
Barron sent for Gordon and showed him the letters
which had passed. Although the commodore hoped
that the matter was disposed of, and assumed that
Captain Humphreys would give some notice in case
of further action, he could not but feel a show of
energy to be proper, and he directed Gordon to order
the gun-deck to be cleared. Instantly the officers
began to prepare the ship for action.</p>

<p>Had the British admiral sent the “Bellona” or
some other seventy-four on this ugly errand, Barron’s
error would have been less serious; for the captain
of a seventy-four would have felt himself strong
enough to allow delay. Sending the “Leopard” was
arrogance of a kind that the British navy at that time
frequently displayed. In 1804, when the Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
treasure-ships were seized, the bitterest complaint of
Spain was not that she had been made the unsuspecting
victim of piracy, but that her squadron had been
waylaid by one of only equal force, and could not in
honor yield without a massacre which cost four ships
and three hundred lives, besides the disgrace of submission
to an enemy of not superior strength. The
“Leopard” did indeed carry fifty-two guns, while the
“Chesapeake” on this cruise carried only forty; but
the “Chesapeake’s” twelve carronades threw heavier
shot than the “Leopard’s” heaviest, and her broadside
weighed 444 pounds, while that of the “Leopard”
weighed 447. In tonnage the “Chesapeake” was a
stronger ship and carried a larger crew than the
“Leopard;” and a battle on fair terms would have
been no certain victory. That Captain Humphreys
felt it necessary to gain and retain every possible
advantage was evident from his conduct. He could
not afford to run the risk of defeat in such an undertaking;
and knowing that the “Chesapeake” needed
time to prepare for battle, he felt not strong enough
to disregard her power of resistance, as he might
have done had he commanded a ship of the line. To
carry out his orders with as little loss as possible
was his duty; for the consequences, not he but his
admiral was to blame. Without a moment of delay,
edging nearer, he hailed and cried: “Commodore
Barron, you must be aware of the necessity I am under
of complying with the orders of my commander-in-chief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Hardly more than five minutes passed between the
moment when the British officer left Commodore
Barron’s cabin and the time when Barron was hailed.
To get the ship ready for action required fully half
an hour. Barron, after giving the order to clear the
guns, had come on deck and was standing in the gangway
watching the “Leopard” with rapidly increasing
anxiety, as he saw that the tompions were out of her
guns and that her crew were evidently at quarters.
He instantly repeated the order to prepare for battle,
and told Gordon to hurry the men to their stations
quietly without drum-beat. Gordon hastened down to
the gun-deck with the keys of the magazine; the crew
sprang to their quarters as soon as they understood
the order. Barron, aware that his only chance was to
gain time, remained at the gangway and replied
through his trumpet: “I do not hear what you say.”
Captain Humphreys repeated his hail, and Barron
again replied that he did not understand. The “Leopard”
immediately fired a shot across the “Chesapeake’s”
bow;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a minute later another shot followed;
and in two minutes more, at half-past four o’clock,
the “Leopard” poured her whole broadside of solid
shot and canister, at the distance of one hundred and
fifty or two hundred feet, point-blank into the helpless
American frigate. Before the gunner of the “Chesapeake”
got to his magazine he heard the first gun
from the “Leopard;” just as he opened and entered
the magazine the “Leopard’s” broadside was fired.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<p>No situation could be more trying to officers and
crew than to be thus stationed at their guns without
a chance to return a fire. The guns of the “Chesapeake”
were loaded, but could not be discharged for
want of lighted matches or heated loggerheads; and
even if discharged, they could not be reloaded until
ammunition should be handed from the magazine.
Time was required both to clear the guns and to fire
them; but the “Leopard’s” first broadside was thrown
just as the crew were beginning to clear the deck.
The crew were fresh and untrained; but no complaint
was made on this account,—all were willing enough
to fight. The confusion was little greater than might
have occurred under the same circumstances in the
best-drilled crew afloat; and the harshest subsequent
scrutiny discovered no want of discipline, except that
toward the end a few men left their guns, declaring
that they were ready to fight but, not to be shot
down like sheep. About the magazine the confusion
was greatest, for a crowd of men and boys were
clamoring for matches, powder-flasks, and loggerheads,
while the gunner and his mates were doing
their utmost to pass up what was needed; but in
reasonable time all wants could have been supplied.
On the upper deck both officers and men behaved
well. Barron, though naturally much excited, showed
both sense and courage. Standing in the open gangway
fully exposed to the “Leopard’s” guns, he was
wounded by the first broadside, but remained either
there or on the quarter-deck without noticing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
wound, while he repeatedly hailed the “Leopard” in
the hope of gaining a moment’s time, and sent officer
after officer below to hurry the men at the guns.
Neither among the officers nor among the crew was
courage the resource that failed them. Many of the
men on the upper deck exposed themselves unnecessarily
to the flying grapeshot by standing on the guns
and looking over the hammocks, till Barron ordered
them down. Careful subsequent inquiry could detect
no lack of gallantry except in the pilot, who when
questioned as to the commodore’s behavior had the
manliness to confess his alarm,—“I was too bad
scared myself to observe him very particularly.”</p>

<p>The British account, which was very exact, said
that the “Leopard’s” fire lasted fifteen minutes,—from
4.30 to 4.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,—during which time three full
broadsides were discharged without return. No one
could demand that Commodore Barron should subject
his crew and ship to a longer trial when he had no
hope of success. The time in which the “Leopard”
could have sunk the “Chesapeake” might be a matter
of doubt; but in the next battle between similar
ships, five years afterward, the “Constitution,” with
about the “Leopard’s” armament, totally disabled the
“Guerriere” in less than thirty minutes, so that she
sank within twenty-four hours,—though at the time
of the action a heavy sea was running, and the “Guerriere”
fought desperately with her whole broadside
of twenty-five guns. June 22, 1807, the sea was calm;
the “Leopard” lay quietly within pistol-shot; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
“Chesapeake” could not injure her; and if the “Leopard”
was as well fought as the “Constitution” she
should have done at least equal damage. If she did
not succeed, it was not for want of trying. The
official survey, taken the next day, showed twenty-two
round-shot in the “Chesapeake’s” hull, ten shot-holes
in the sails, all three masts badly injured, the
rigging much cut by grape, three men killed, eight
severely and ten slightly wounded, including Commodore
Barron,—which proved that of the seventy or
eighty discharges from the “Leopard’s” guns a large
proportion took effect.</p>

<p>After enduring this massacre for fifteen minutes,
while trying to fire back at least one gun for the
honor of the ship, Commodore Barron ordered the
flag to be struck. It was hauled down; and as it
touched the taffrail one gun was discharged from
the gun-deck sending a shot into the “Leopard.”
This single gun was fired by the third lieutenant,
Allen, by means of a live coal which he brought in
his fingers from the galley.</p>

<p>The boats of the “Leopard” then came on board,
bringing several British officers, who mustered the
ship’s company. They selected the three Americans
who had deserted from the “Melampus,” and were
therefore not included in Berkeley’s order. Twelve
or fifteen others were pointed out as English deserters,
but these men were not taken. After a search
of the ship, Jenkin Ratford was dragged out of the
coal-hole; and this discovery alone saved Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Humphreys from the blame of committing an outrage
not only lawless but purposeless. At about seven
o’clock the British officers left the ship, taking with
them the three Americans and Jenkin Ratford. Immediately
afterward Commodore Barron sent Lieutenant
Allen on board the “Leopard” with a brief letter
to Captain Humphreys:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I consider the frigate ‘Chesapeake’ your prize, and
am ready to deliver her to any officer authorized to receive
her. By the return of the boat I shall expect your
answer.”</p>
</div>

<p>The British captain immediately replied as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having to the utmost of my power fulfilled the instructions
of my commander-in-chief, I have nothing more
to desire, and must in consequence proceed to join the remainder
of the squadron,—repeating that I am ready to
give you every assistance in my power, and do most sincerely
deplore that any lives should have been lost in the
execution of a service which might have been adjusted
more amicably, not only with respect to ourselves but the
nations to which we respectively belong.”</p>
</div>

<p>At eight o’clock Barron called a council of officers
to consider what was best to be done with the
ship, and it was unanimously decided to return to
the Roads and wait orders. Disgraced, degraded,
with officers and crew smarting under a humiliation
that was never forgotten or forgiven, the unlucky
“Chesapeake” dragged her way back to Norfolk.</p>

<p>There she lay for many months. Barron’s wrong
was in the nature of a crime. His brother officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
made severe comments on his conduct; and Captain
Gordon and some of his fellow-sufferers joined in the
cry. One of his harshest critics was Stephen Decatur.
Public sentiment required a victim. A court of inquiry
which sat at Norfolk in October reported
strongly against the commodore. He was charged
with neglect of duty, with having failed to prepare
his ship for action, with having surrendered prematurely,
with having discouraged his men; but beneath
all these charges lay an unjust belief in his want of
courage. After six months delay, Barron was brought
before a court-martial Jan. 4, 1808, and allowed to
make his defence.</p>

<p>The court-martial took place at Norfolk, on board
the “Chesapeake,”—his own ship, which recalled at
every moment his disgrace. The judges were his
juniors, with the single exception of Captain John
Rodgers, who was president of the court. Among
them sat Stephen Decatur,—a brilliant officer, but
one who had still to undergo the experience of striking
his flag and of hearing the world suspect his surrender
to be premature. Decatur held strong opinions
against Barron, and not only expressed them strongly,
but also notified Barron of them in order that he
might, if he pleased, exercise the privilege of challenging.
Barron made no objection, and Decatur unwillingly
kept his place. In other respects Barron
was still more hardly treated by fortune; the first
lieutenant of the “Chesapeake” had died in the interval;
Dr. Bullus, whose evidence was of the utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
importance, could not appear; Captain Gordon turned
against him, and expressed the free opinion that
Barron had never meant to resist; Captains Murray,
Hull, and Chauncey, on the court of inquiry, had
already made a hostile report; and the government
prosecutor pressed every charge with a persistency
that, as coming from the Department, seemed almost
vindictive.</p>

<p>From January 4 to February 8 the court-martial
tried charges against Barron, after which it continued
until February 22 trying Captain Gordon, Captain
Hall of the marines, and William Hook the gunner.
The result of this long, searching, and severe investigation
was remarkable, for it ended in a very elaborate
decision<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that Barron was blameless in every particular
except one. He had not been negligent of his
duty; he was not to blame for omitting to call the
crew to quarters before he received Captain Humphreys’
letter; he did well in getting the men to
quarters secretly without drum-beat; he did not discourage
his men; he had shown coolness, reflection,
and personal courage under the most trying circumstances;
he was right in striking his flag when he
did,—but he was wrong in failing to prepare for action
instantly on reading Admiral Berkeley’s order;
and for this mistake he was condemned to suspension
for five years from the service, without pay or
emoluments.</p>

<p>Barron had argued that although his judgment on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
this point proved to be mistaken, it was reasonable,
and in accord with his instructions. He produced
the orders of the Secretary of the Navy, dated May
15, 1807, written with full knowledge that the deserters
from the “Melampus” had been claimed by the
British minister, and that a British squadron was
lying in Chesapeake Bay. “Our interest as well as
good faith requires,” said the secretary, “... that
we should cautiously avoid whatever may have a
tendency to bring us into collision with any other
Power.” Barron urged that if he had given the order
to prepare for battle as required by the court-martial,
he must have detained by force the British
lieutenant and his boat’s crew, which would have had
a direct “tendency to bring us into collision,” or he
must have let them go, which would have hurried the
collision. He said that he had tried to gain time by
keeping the appearances of confidence and good-will.
He admitted that he had failed, but claimed that
the failure was due to no fault which could have been
corrected at that moment by those means.</p>

<p>The defence was open to criticism, especially because
Barron himself could claim to have made no
use of the time he gained. Yet perhaps, on the whole,
the court-martial might have done better to punish
Barron for his want of caution in permitting the
British frigate to approach. This was his first error,
which could not be retrieved; and Barron could
hardly have complained of his punishment, even
though every officer in the service knew that the rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
of going to quarters in such cases was seldom strictly
observed. The President and the Secretary of the
Navy could alone say whether Barron had understood
their orders correctly, and whether his plea, founded
on the secretary’s instructions, was sound. In the
light of Jefferson’s diplomacy, Barron’s course accorded
with his instructions; and perhaps, had the
President claimed his own share in the “Chesapeake’s”
disaster, he would have refused to degrade
a faithful, able, and gallant seaman for obeying the
spirit and letter of his orders. Unfortunately such
an interference would have ruined the navy; and so
it happened that what Jefferson had so long foreseen
took place. He had maintained that the frigates
were a mere invitation to attack; that they created
the dangers they were built to resist, and tempted the
aggressions of Great Britain, which would, but for
these ships, find no object to covet; and when the
prediction turned true, he was still obliged to maintain
the character of the service. He approved the
sentence of the court-martial.</p>

<p>So far as the service was concerned, Barron’s punishment
was not likely to stimulate its caution, for no
American captain, unless he wished to be hung by his
own crew at his own yard-arm, was likely ever again
to let a British frigate come within gunshot without
taking such precautions as he would have taken
against a pirate; but though the degradation could
do little for the service, it cost Barron his honor, and
ended by costing Decatur his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Humphreys reported to Captain
Douglas on the “Bellona,” and Captain Douglas reported
the whole affair to Admiral Berkeley at Halifax,
who received at the same time accounts from
American sources. The admiral immediately wrote
to approve the manner in which his orders had been
carried out. “As far as I am enabled to judge,” he
said<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in a letter to Captain Humphreys, dated July 4,
“you have conducted yourself most properly.” The
inevitable touch of unconscious comedy was not wanting
in the British admiral, whose character recalled
Smollett’s novels and memories of Commodore Hawser
Trunnion. “I hope you mind the public accounts
which have been published of this affair as little
as I do,” he continued; “we must make allowances
for the heated state of the populace in a country
where law and every tie, both civil and religious, is
treated so lightly.” No broader humor could be
found in “Peregrine Pickle” than in one breath to
approve an act so lawless that no man of common-sense
even in England ventured to defend it as lawful,
and in the next to read the Americans a moral
lecture on their want of law and religion; yet grotesque
as this old-fashioned naval morality might be,
no man in England noticed either its humor or its
absurdity.</p>

<p>As though to show that he meant no humor by it,
the admiral, August 25, called a court-martial, which
the next day sentenced Jenkin Ratford to be hanged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and the three American deserters from the “Melampus”
to receive five hundred lashes each. The last
part of the sentence was not carried out, and the
three Americans remained quietly in prison; but August
31, Jenkin Ratford was duly hanged from the
foreyard-arm of his own ship, the “Halifax.”</p>

</div>


<p>For the first time in their history the people of the
United States learned, in June, 1807, the feeling of a
true national emotion. Hitherto every public passion
had been more or less partial and one-sided; even
the death of Washington had been ostentatiously
mourned in the interests and to the profit of party:
but the outrage committed on the “Chesapeake”
stung through hide-bound prejudices, and made democrat
and aristocrat writhe alike. The brand seethed
and hissed like the glowing olive-stake of Ulysses
in the Cyclops’ eye, until the whole American people,
like Cyclops, roared with pain and stood frantic on
the shore, hurling abuse at their enemy, who taunted
them from his safe ships. The mob at Norfolk, furious
at the sight of their dead and wounded comrades
from the “Chesapeake,” ran riot, and in the want of
a better object of attack destroyed the water-casks
of the British squadron. July 29 the town forbade
communication with the ships in Lynnhaven Bay,
which caused Captain Douglas to write to the Mayor
of Norfolk a letter much in the tone of Admiral
Berkeley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You must be perfectly aware,” said he, “that the
British flag never has been, nor will be, insulted with
impunity. You must also be aware that it has been, and
still is, in my power to obstruct the whole trade of the
Chesapeake since the late circumstance; which I desisted
from, trusting that general unanimity would be restored....
Agreeably to my intentions, I have proceeded to
Hampton Roads, with the squadron under my command,
to await your answer, which I trust you will favor me
with without delay.”</p>
</div>

<p>He demanded that the prohibition of intercourse
should be “immediately annulled.” The Mayor sent
Littleton Tazewell to carry an answer to this warlike
demand from the “Bellona,” and Tazewell was
somewhat surprised to find Captain Douglas highly
conciliatory, and unable to see what the people of
Norfolk could have found in his letter which could be
regarded as “menacing;” but meanwhile all Virginia
was aroused, an attack on Norfolk was generally expected,
the coast was patrolled by an armed force,
and the British men-of-war were threatened by
mounted militia.</p>

<p>In the Northern States the feeling was little less
violent. Public meetings were everywhere held. At
New York, July 2, the citizens, at a meeting over
which De Witt Clinton presided, denounced “the dastardly
and unprovoked attack” on the “Chesapeake,”
and pledged themselves to support the government
“in whatever measures it may deem necessary to
adopt in the present crisis of affairs.” At Boston,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
where the town government was wholly Federalist,
a moment of hesitation occurred.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The principal
Federalists consulted with each other, and decided
not to call a town-meeting. July 10 an informal
meeting was called by the Republicans, over which
Elbridge Gerry presided, and which Senator J. Q.
Adams alone among the prominent Federalists attended.
There also a resolution was adopted,
pledging cheerful co-operation “in any measures,
however serious,” which the Administration might
deem necessary for the safety and honor of the
country. In a few days public opinion compelled
the Federalists to change their tone. A town-meeting
was held at Faneuil Hall July 16, and Senator
Adams again reported resolutions, which were unanimously
adopted, pledging effectual support to the government.
Yet the Essex Junto held aloof; neither
George Cabot, Theophilus Parsons, nor Timothy
Pickering would take part in such proceedings, and
the Federalist newspaper which was supposed to
represent their opinions went so far as to assert
that Admiral Berkeley’s doctrine was correct, and
that British men-of-war had a right to take deserters
from the national vessels of the United States. In
private, this opinion was hotly maintained; in public,
its expression was generally thought unwise in face
of popular excitement.</p>

<p>President Jefferson was at Washington June 25,
the day when news of the outrage arrived; but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Cabinet was widely scattered, and some time passed
before its members could be reassembled. Gallatin
was last to arrive; but July 2, at a full meeting, the
President read the draft of a proclamation, which
was approved, and the proclamation issued on the
same day. It rehearsed the story of American
injuries and forbearance, and of British aggressions
upon neutral rights; and so moderate was its tone
as to convey rather the idea of deprecation than
of anger:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hospitality under such circumstances ceases to be a
duty; and a continuance of it, with such uncontrolled
abuses, would tend only, by multiplying injuries and
irritations, to bring on a rupture between the two nations.
This extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of
both, as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions
on the part of the British government, in the midst
of which this outrage has been committed. In this light
the subject cannot but present itself to that government,
and strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation of
the wrong which has been done, and to that effectual
control of its naval commanders which alone can justify
the government of the United States in the exercise of
those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.”</p>
</div>

<p>With this preamble the proclamation required all
armed vessels of Great Britain to depart from American
waters; and in case of their failing to do so, the
President forbade intercourse with them, and prohibited
supplies to be furnished them.</p>

<p>At the same Cabinet meeting, according to Jefferson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
memoranda,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> other measures were taken. The
gunboats were ordered to points where attack might
be feared. The President was to “recall all our
vessels from the Mediterranean, by a vessel to be
sent express, and send the ‘Revenge’ to England
with despatches to our minister demanding satisfaction
for the attack on the ‘Chesapeake;’ in which
must be included—(1) a disavowal of the act and
of the principle of searching a public armed vessel;
(2) a restoration of the men taken; (3) a recall of
Admiral Berkeley. Communicate the incident which
has happened to Russia.” Two days afterward, at
another Cabinet meeting, it was “agreed that a call
of Congress shall issue the fourth Monday of August
(24), to meet the fourth Monday in October (26),
unless new occurrences should render an earlier call
necessary. Robert Smith wished an earlier call.”
He was not alone in this wish. Gallatin wrote
privately to his wife that he wanted an immediate
call, and that the chief objection to it, which would
not be openly avowed, was the unhealthiness of
Washington city.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The news of Captain Douglas’s threatening conduct
and language at Norfolk produced further measures.
July 5 “it was agreed to call on the governors of the
States to have their quotas of one hundred thousand
militia in readiness. The object is to have the portions
on the sea-coast ready for any emergency; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
for those in the North we may look to a winter expedition
against Canada.” July 7 it was “agreed to
desire the Governor of Virginia to order such portion
of militia into actual service as may be necessary for
defence of Norfolk and of the gunboats at Hampton
and in Matthews County.” Little by little Jefferson
was drawn into preparations for actual war.</p>

<p>Even among earnest Republicans the tone of Jefferson’s
proclamation and the character of his measures
were at first denounced as tame. John Randolph
called the proclamation an “apology;” Joseph Nicholson
wrote to Gallatin a remonstrance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But one feeling pervades the nation,” said he;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
“all distinctions of Federalism and Democracy are vanished.
The people are ready to submit to any deprivation;
and if we withdraw ourselves within our own shell,
and turn loose some thousands of privateers, we shall
obtain in a little time an absolute renunciation of the
right of search for the purposes of impressment. A
parley will prove fatal; for the merchants will begin to
calculate. They rule us, and we should take them before
their resentment is superseded by considerations of profit
and loss. I trust in God the ‘Revenge’ is going out to
bring Monroe and Pinkney home.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gallatin, who had hitherto thrown all his influence
on the side of peace, was then devoting all his
energies to provision for war. He answered Nicholson
that the tone of Government, though he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
it correct, was of little consequence, for in any case
the result would be the same; he was confident
that England would give neither satisfaction nor
security.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will, however, acknowledge that on that particular
point I have not bestowed much thought; for having
considered from the first moment war was a necessary
result, and the preliminaries appearing to me but matters
of form, my faculties have been exclusively applied to
the preparations necessary to meet the times. And although
I am not very sanguine as to the brilliancy of our
exploits, the field where we can act without a navy being
very limited, and perfectly aware that a war, in a great
degree passive, and consisting of privations, will become
very irksome to the people, I feel no apprehension of the
immediate result. We will be poorer both as a nation
and as a government, our debt and taxes will increase,
and our progress in every respect be interrupted; but
all those evils are not only not to be put in competition
with the independence and honor of the nation, they are
moreover temporary, and a very few years of peace
will obliterate their effects. Nor do I know whether the
awakening of nobler feelings and habits than avarice
and luxury might not be necessary to prevent our degenerating,
like the Hollanders, into a nation of mere
calculators.”</p>
</div>

<p>Jefferson followed without protest the impulse
toward war; but his leading thought was to avoid it.
Peace was still his passion, and his scheme of peaceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
coercion had not yet been tried. Even while the
nation was aflame with warlike enthusiasm, his own
mind always reverted to another thought. The tone
of the proclamation showed it; his unwillingness to
call Congress proved it; his letters dwelt upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have acted on these principles,” he wrote in regard
to England,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>—“(1) to give that Government an
opportunity to disavow and make reparation; (2) to give
ourselves time to get in the vessels, property, and seamen
now spread over the ocean; (3) to do no act which
might compromit Congress in their choice between war,
non-intercourse, or any other measure.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Vice-President Clinton he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that since the
power of declaring war was with the Legislature, the
Executive should do nothing necessarily committing
them to decide for war in preference to non-intercourse,
“which will be preferred by a great many.”
Every letter<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> written by the President during the
crisis contained some allusion to non-intercourse,
which he still called the “peaceable means of repressing
injustice, by making it the interest of the
aggressor to do what is just, and abstain from future
wrong.” As the war fever grew stronger he talked
more boldly about hostilities, and became silent about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
non-intercourse;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but the delay in calling Congress
was certain to work as he wished, and to prevent a
committal to the policy of war.</p>

<p>To no one was this working of Jefferson’s mind
more evident than to General Turreau, whose keen
eyes made the President uneasy under the sense of
being watched and criticised. Turreau, who had left
Washington for the summer, hurried back on hearing
of the “Chesapeake” disaster. On arriving, he
went the same evening to the White House, “where
there had been a dinner of twenty covers, composed,
they say, of new friends of the Government, to whom
Mr. Madison had given a first representation two days
before. Indeed, I knew none of the guests except
the Ambassador of England and his secretary of
legation. The President received me even better
than usual, but left me, presently, to follow with
the British minister a conversation that my entrance
had interrupted.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Then came a touch of nature which Turreau
thought strikingly characteristic. No strong power
of imagination is needed to see the White House
parlor, on the warm summer night, with Jefferson,
as Senator Maclay described him, sitting in a lounging
manner on one hip, with his loose, long figure,
and his clothes that seemed too small for him, talking,
without a break, in his rambling, disjointed way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
showing deep excitement under an affectation of coolness,
and at every word and look betraying himself
to the prying eyes of Talleyrand’s suspicious agent.
What Jefferson said, and how he said it, can be
told only in Turreau’s version; but perhaps the few
words used by the prejudiced Frenchman gave a
clearer idea of American politics than could be got
from all other sources together:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This conversation with the British minister having
been brought to an end, Mr. Jefferson came and sat
down by my side; and after all the American guests had
successively retired, Mr. Erskine, who had held out
longest,—in the hope, perhaps, that I should quit the
ground,—went away also. The President spoke to me
about the ‘Chesapeake’ affair, and said: ‘If the English
do not give us the satisfaction we demand, we will take
Canada, which wants to enter the Union; and when,
together with Canada, we shall have the Floridas, we
shall no longer have any difficulties with our neighbors;
and it is the only way of preventing them. I expected
that the Emperor would return sooner to Paris,—and
then this affair of the Floridas would be ended.’ Then,
changing the subject, he asked me what were the means
to employ in order to be able to defend the American
harbors and coasts. I answered that the choice of means
depended on local conditions, and that his officers, after
an exact reconnoissance, ought to pronounce on the
application of suitable means of defence.—‘We have
no officers!’—He treated twenty-seven different subjects
in a conversation of half an hour; and as he
showed, as usual, no sort of distrust, this conversation
of fits and starts (<i>à bâtons rompus</i>) makes me infer that
the event would embarrass him much,—and Mr. Madison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
seemed to me to share this embarrassment.... Once
for all, whatever may be the disposition of mind here,
though every one is lashing himself (<i>se batte les flancs</i>)
to take a warlike attitude, I can assure your Highness
that the President does not want war, and that Mr.
Madison dreads it still more. I am convinced that these
two personages will do everything that is possible to
avoid it, and that if Congress, which will be called
together only when an answer shall have arrived from
England, should think itself bound, as organ of public
opinion, to determine on war, its intention will be
crossed by powerful intrigues, because the actual Administration
has nothing to gain and everything to lose
by war.”</p>
</div>

<p>Turreau was not the only observer who saw beneath
the surface of American politics. The young British
minister, Erskine, who enlivened his despatches by
no such lightness of touch as was usual with his
French colleague, wrote to the new Foreign Secretary
of England, George Canning, only brief and dry
accounts of the situation at Washington, but showed
almost a flash of genius in the far-reaching policy
he struck out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ferment in the public mind,” he wrote July 21,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
“has not yet subsided, and I am confirmed in the opinion
... that this country will engage in war rather than submit
to their national armed ships being forcibly searched
on the high seas.... Should his Majesty think fit to
cause an apology to be offered to these States on account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of the attack of his Majesty’s ship ‘Leopard’ on
the United States frigate ‘Chesapeake,’ it would have
the most powerful effect not only on the minds of the
people of this country, but would render it impossible for
the Congress to bring on a war upon the other points of
difference between his Majesty and the United States at
present under discussion.”</p>
</div>

<p>A single blow, however violent, could not weld a
nation. Every one saw that the very violence of
temper which made the month of July, 1807, a moment
without a parallel in American history since
the battle of Lexington, would be followed by a long
reaction of doubt and discord. If the President, the
Secretary of State, and great numbers of their stanchest
friends hesitated to fight when a foreign nation,
after robbing their commerce, fired into their ships
of war, and slaughtered or carried off their fellow-citizens,—if
they preferred “peaceable means of repressing
injustice” at the moment when every nerve
would naturally have been strung to recklessness with
the impulse to strike back,—it was in the highest
degree unlikely that they would be more earnest for
war when time had deadened the sense of wrong.
Neither England, France, nor Spain could fail to
see that the moment when aggression ceased to be
safe had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The people were deeply excited, commerce for the
moment was paralyzed, no merchant dared send out a
ship, and the country resounded with cries of war
when the “Revenge” sailed, bearing instructions to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Monroe to demand reparation from the British government.
These instructions, dated July 6, 1807,
were framed in the spirit which seemed to characterize
Madison’s diplomatic acts. Specific redress for
a specific wrong appeared an easy demand. That the
attack on the “Chesapeake” should be disavowed;
that the men who had been seized should be restored;
that punctilious exactness of form should
mark the apology and retribution,—was matter of
course; but that this special outrage, which stood on
special ground, should be kept apart, and that its
atonement should precede the consideration of every
other disputed point, was the natural method of dealing
with it if either party was serious in wishing for
peace. Such a wound, left open to fester and smart,
was certain to make war in the end inevitable. Both
the President and Madison wanted peace; yet their
instructions to Monroe made a settlement of the
“Chesapeake” outrage impracticable by binding it
to a settlement of the wider dispute as to impressments
from merchant vessels.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As a security for the future,” wrote Madison,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> “an
entire abolition of impressments from vessels under the
flag of the United States, if not already arranged, is also
to make an indispensable part of the satisfaction.”</p>
</div>

<p>Among the many impossibilities which had been
required of Monroe during the last four years, this
was one of the plainest. The demand was preliminary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
in ordinary diplomatic usage, to a declaration
of war; and nothing in Jefferson’s Presidency was
more surprising than that he should have thought
such a policy of accumulating unsettled causes for
war consistent with his policy of peace.</p>

<p>While the “Revenge” was slowly working across
the Atlantic, Monroe in London was exposed to the
full rigor of the fresh storm. News of the “Chesapeake”
affair reached London July 25; and before
it could become public Canning wrote to Monroe a
private note,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> cautiously worded, announcing that a
“transaction” had taken place “off the coast of
America,” the particulars of which he was not at
present enabled to communicate, and was anxious to
receive from Monroe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“But whatever the real merits and character of the
transaction may turn out to be, Mr. Canning could not
forbear expressing without delay the sincere concern
and sorrow which he feels at its unfortunate result,
and assuring the American minister, both from himself
and on the behalf of his Majesty’s government,
that if the British officers should prove to have been
culpable, the most prompt and effectual reparation shall
be afforded to the government of the United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>When on Monday morning, July 27, Monroe read
in the newspapers the account of what had taken
place, and realized that Canning, while giving out
that he knew not the particulars, must have had
Admiral Berkeley’s official report within his reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
if not on his table, the American minister could not
but feel that the British secretary might have spoken
with more frankness. In truth ministers were waiting
to consult the law, and to learn whether Berkeley
could be sustained. The extreme Tories, who wanted
a quarrel with the United States; the reckless, who
were delighted with every act of violence, which
they called energy; the mountebanks, represented
by Cobbett, who talked at random according to personal
prejudices,—all approved Berkeley’s conduct.
The Ministry, not yet accustomed to office, and disposed
to assert the power they held, could not easily
reconcile themselves to disavowing a British admiral
whose popular support came from the ranks of their
own party. Seeing this, Monroe became more and
more alarmed.</p>

<p>The tone of the press was extravagant enough
to warrant despair. July 27 the “Morning Post,”
which was apt to draw its inspiration from the Foreign
Office, contained a diatribe on the “Chesapeake”
affair.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“America,” it said, “is not contented with striking at
the very vitals of our commercial existence; she must also,
by humbling our naval greatness and disputing our supremacy,
not only lessen us in our own estimation, but
degrade us in the eyes of Europe and of the world....
It will never be permitted to be said that the ‘Royal
Sovereign’ has struck her flag to a Yankee cockboat.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the whole press of England, the “Morning
Chronicle” alone deprecated an American war or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
blamed Berkeley’s act; and the “Morning Chronicle”
was the organ of opposition.</p>

<p>Monroe waited two days, and heard no more
from Canning. July 29, by a previous appointment,
he went to the Foreign Office on other business.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
He found the Foreign Secretary still reticent, admitting
or yielding nothing, but willing to satisfy
the American government that Berkeley’s order
had not been the result of instructions from the
Tory ministry. Monroe said he would send a note
on the subject, and Canning acquiesced. Monroe
on the same day sent his letter, which called attention
to the outrage that had been committed
and to its unjustifiable nature, expressing at the
same time full confidence that the British government
would at once disavow and punish the
offending officer. The tone of the note, though
strong, was excellent, but on one point did not
quite accord with the instructions on their way from
Washington.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I might state,” said Monroe, “other examples of
great indignity and outrage, many of which are of recent
date; ... but it is improper to mingle them with
the present more serious cause of complaint.”</p>
</div>

<p>Monday, August 3, Canning sent a brief reply.
Since Monroe’s complaint was not founded on official
knowledge, said Canning, the King’s government was
not bound to do more than to express readiness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
make reparation if such reparation should prove to
be due:<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of the existence of such a disposition on the part of
the British government you, sir, cannot be ignorant. I
have already assured you of it, though in an unofficial
form, by the letter which I addressed to you on the first
receipt of the intelligence of this unfortunate transaction;
and I may perhaps be permitted to express my
surprise, after such an assurance, at the tone of that representation
which I have just had the honor to receive
from you. But the earnest desire of his Majesty to
evince in the most satisfactory manner the principles
of justice and moderation by which he is uniformly actuated,
has not permitted him to hesitate in commanding
me to assure you that his Majesty neither does nor has at
any time maintained the pretension of a right to search
ships of war in the national service of any State for
deserters.”</p>
</div>

<p>If it should prove that Berkeley’s order rested
on no other ground than the simple and unqualified
pretension to such a right, the King had no difficulty
in disavowing it, and would have none in showing his
displeasure at it.</p>

<p>Although Monroe thought this reply to be “addressed
in rather a harsh tone,” as was certainly the
case, he considered it intended to concede the essential
point, and he decided to say no more without instructions.
He might well be satisfied, for Canning’s
“surprise” was a mild expression of public feeling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Hitherto the British press had shown no marked
signs of the insanity which sometimes seized a people
under the strain of great excitement, but the
“Chesapeake” affair revealed the whole madness of
the time. August 6, three days after Canning had
disavowed pretension to search national vessels, the
“Morning Post” published an article strongly in
favor of Berkeley and war. “Three weeks blockade
of the Delaware, the Chesapeake, and Boston
Harbor would make our presumptuous rivals repent
of their puerile conduct.” August 5 the “Times”
declared itself for Berkeley, and approved not only
his order, but also its mode of execution. The
“Courier” from the first defended Berkeley. Cobbett’s
peculiar powers of mischief were never more
skilfully exerted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not pretend to say that we may not in this instance
have been in the wrong, because there is nothing
authentic upon the subject; nor am I prepared to say
that our right of search, <i>in all cases</i>, extends to ships
of war. But of this I am certain, that if the laws of
nations do not allow you to search for deserters in a
friend’s territory, neither do they allow that friend to
inveigle away your troops or your seamen, to do which
is an act of hostility; and I ask for no better proof of
inveigling than the enlisting and refusing to give up such
troops or seamen.”</p>
</div>

<p>Owing to his long residence in the United States,
Cobbett was considered a high authority on American
affairs; and he boldly averred that America could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
not go to war without destroying herself as a political
body. More than half the people of America, he
said, were already disgusted with the French bias of
their government.</p>

<p>In the face of a popular frenzy so general, Monroe
might feel happy to have already secured from Canning
an express disavowal of the pretension to search
ships of war. He was satisfied to let the newspapers
say what they would while he waited his instructions.
A month passed before these arrived. September 3
Monroe had his next interview, and explained the
President’s expectations,—that the men taken from
the “Chesapeake” should be restored, the offenders
punished, a special mission sent to America to
announce the reparation, and the practice of impressment
from merchant-vessels suppressed.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Canning
listened with civility, for he took pride in tempering
the sternness of his policy by the courtesy of his manner.
He made no serious objection to the President’s
demands so far as they concerned the “Chesapeake;”
but when Monroe came to the abandonment of impressment
from merchant-vessels, he civilly declined
to admit it into the discussion.</p>

<p>Monroe wrote the next day a note,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> founded on
his instructions, in which he insisted on the proposition
which he had expressly discarded in his note of
July 29, that the outrages rising from impressment
in general ought to be considered as a part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
“Chesapeake” affair; and he concluded his argument
by saying that his Government looked on this complete
adjustment as indispensably necessary to heal
the deep wound which had been inflicted on the
national honor of the United States. After the severity
with which Monroe had been rebuked for disregarding
his instructions on this point barely a few
months before, he had no choice but to obey his
orders without the change of a letter; but he doubtless
knew in advance that this course left Canning
master of the situation. The British government was
too well acquainted with the affairs of America to be
deceived by words. That the United States would
fight to protect their national vessels was possible;
but every one knew that no party in Congress could
be induced to make war for the protection of merchant
seamen. In rejecting such a demand, not
only was Canning safe, but he was also sure of
placing the President at odds with his own followers
and friends.</p>

<p>A fortnight was allowed to pass before the British
government replied. Then, September 23, Canning
sent to the American legation an answer.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He began
by requesting to know whether the President’s proclamation
was authentic, and whether it would be withdrawn
on a disavowal of the act which led to it;
because, as an act of retaliation, it must be taken
into account in adjusting the reparation due. He
insisted that the nationality of the men seized must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
also be taken into account, not as warranting their
unauthorized seizure, but as a question of redress
between government and government. In respect to
the general question of impressment in connection
with the specific grievance of the “Chesapeake,” he
explained at some length the different ground on
which the two disputes rested; and while professing
his willingness to discuss the regulation of the
practice, he affirmed the rights of England, which,
he said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“existed in their fullest force for ages previous to the
establishment of the United States of America as an
independent government; and it would be difficult to
contend that the recognition of that independence can
have operated any change in this respect, unless it can
be shown that in acknowledging the government of the
United States, Great Britain virtually abdicated her own
rights as a naval Power, or unless there were any express
stipulations by which the ancient and prescriptive usages
of Great Britain, founded in the soundest principles of
natural law, though still enforced against other independent
nations of the world, were to be suspended whenever
they might come in contact with the interests or the feelings
of the American people.”</p>
</div>

<p>After disposing of the matter with this sneer, Canning
closed by earnestly recommending Monroe to
consider whether his instructions might not leave him
at liberty to adjust the case of the “Chesapeake”
by itself:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If your instructions leave you no discretion, I cannot
press you to act in contradiction to them. In that case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
there can be no advantage in pursuing a discussion which
you are not authorized to conclude; and I shall have only
to regret that the disposition of his Majesty to terminate
that difference amicably and satisfactorily is for the present
rendered unavailing.</p>

<p>“In that case his Majesty, in pursuance of the disposition
of which he has given such signal proofs, will lose
no time in sending a minister to America, furnished with
the necessary instructions and powers for bringing this
unfortunate dispute to a conclusion consistent with the
harmony subsisting between Great Britain and the United
States; but in order to avoid the inconvenience which
has arisen from the mixed nature of your instructions,
that minister will not be empowered to entertain, as connected
with this subject, any proposition respecting the
search of merchant-vessels.”</p>
</div>

<p>Monroe replied,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> September 29, that his instructions
were explicit, and that he could not separate
the two questions. He closed by saying that Canning’s
disposition and sentiments had been such
as inspired him with great confidence that they
should soon have been able to bring the dispute
to an honorable and satisfactory conclusion. With
this letter so far as concerned Monroe, the “Chesapeake”
incident came to its end in failure of
redress.</p>

<p>One more subject remained for Monroe to finish.
His unfortunate treaty returned by Madison with a
long list of changes and omissions, had been made by
Monroe and Pinkney the subject of a letter to Canning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
as early as July 24;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but the affair of the
“Chesapeake” intervened, and Canning declined to
touch any other subject until this was adjusted. No
sooner did he succeed in referring the “Chesapeake”
negotiation to Washington than he turned to the
treaty. That a measure which had been the most
unpopular act of an unpopular Whig ministry could
expect no mercy at Canning’s hands, was to be expected;
but some interest attached to the manner of
rejection which he might prefer. In a formal note,
dated October 22, Canning addressed the American
government in a tone which no one but himself could
so happily use,—a tone of mingled condescension
and derision.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He began by saying that his Majesty
could not profess to be satisfied that the American
government had taken effectual steps in regard to
the Berlin Decree; but the King had nevertheless
decided, in case the President should ratify Monroe’s
treaty, to ratify it in his turn, “reserving to himself
the right of taking, in consequence of that decree,
and of the omission of any effectual interposition on
the part of neutral nations to obtain its revocation,
such measures of retaliation as his Majesty might
judge expedient.” Without stopping to explain what
value a ratification under such conditions would have,
Canning continued that the President had thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
proper to propose alterations in the body of the
treaty:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The undersigned is commanded distinctly to protest
against a practice altogether unusual in the political transactions
of States, by which the American government
assumes to itself the privilege of revising and altering
agreements concluded and signed on its behalf by its
agents duly authorized for that purpose, of retaining so
much of those agreements as may be favorable to its own
views, and of rejecting such stipulations, or such parts
of stipulations, as are conceived to be not sufficiently
beneficial to America.”</p>
</div>

<p>Without discussing the correctness of Canning’s
assertion that the practice was “altogether unusual
in the political transactions of States,” Monroe and
Pinkney might have replied that every European
treaty was negotiated, step by step, under the eye
of the respective governments, and that probably no
extant treaty had been signed by a British agent in
Europe without first receiving at every stage the approval
of the King. No American agent could consult
his government. Canning was officially aware
that Monroe and Pinkney, in signing their treaty, had
done so at their own risk, in violation of the President’s
orders. The requirement that the President
of the United States should follow European rules
was unreasonable; but in the actual instance Canning’s
tone was something more than unreasonable.
His own note assumed for the British government
“the privilege of revising and altering” whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
provisions of the treaty it pleased; and after a condition
so absolute, he violated reciprocity in rejecting
conditions made by the President because they were
“unusual in the political transactions of States:”—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The undersigned is therefore commanded to apprise
the American commissioners that, although his Majesty
will be at all times ready to listen to any suggestions
for arranging, in an amicable and advantageous manner,
the respective interests of the two countries, the proposal
of the President of the United States for proceeding
to negotiate anew upon the basis of a treaty already
solemnly concluded and signed, is a proposal wholly
inadmissible.”</p>
</div>

<p>With this denial of the right of others to exercise
arbitrary methods, Canning declared the field open
for the British government to give full range to its
arbitrary will. A week afterward Monroe left London
forever. He had taken his audience of leave
October 7, and resigned the legation to Pinkney.
October 29 he started for Portsmouth to take ship
for Virginia. His diplomatic career in Europe was at
an end; but these last failures left him in a state of
mind easy to imagine, in which his irritation with
Jefferson and Madison, the authors of his incessant
misfortunes, outran his suspicions of Canning, whose
pretence of friendship had been dignified and smooth.</p>

<p>For reasons to be given hereafter, the Ministry decided
to disavow Admiral Berkeley’s attack on the
“Chesapeake;” but in order to provide against the
reproach of surrendering British rights, a proclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
almost as offensive to the United States as
Admiral Berkeley’s order was issued, October 16.
Beginning with the assertion that great numbers of
British seamen “have been enticed to enter the service
of foreign States, and are now actually serving as
well on board the ships of war belonging to the said
foreign States as on board the merchant-vessels belonging
to their subjects,” the proclamation ordered
such seamen to return home, and commanded all
naval officers to seize them, without unnecessary violence,
in any foreign merchant-vessels where they
might be found, and to demand them from the captains
of foreign ships of war, in order to furnish
government with the necessary evidence for claiming
redress from the government which had detained
the British seamen. Further, the proclamation gave
warning that naturalization would not be regarded as
relieving British subjects of their duties, but that,
while such naturalized persons would be pardoned
if they returned immediately to their allegiance, all
such as should serve on ships-of-war belonging to
any State at enmity with England would be guilty of
high treason, and would be punished with the utmost
severity of the law.</p>

<p>That the British public, even after the battle of
Trafalgar and the firing upon the “Chesapeake,”
might have felt its pride sufficiently flattered by such
a proclamation seemed only reasonable; for in truth
this proclamation forced war upon a government which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
wished only to escape it, and which cowered for years
in submission rather than fight for what it claimed as
its due; but although to American ears the proclamation
sounded like a sentence of slavery, the British
public denounced it as a surrender of British rights.
The “Morning Post,” October 20 and 22, gave way to
a paroxysm of wrath against ministers for disavowing
and recalling Berkeley. “With feelings most
poignantly afflicting,” it broke into a rhapsody of unrestrained
self-will. The next day, October 23, the
same newspaper—then the most influential in the
kingdom—pursued the subject more mildly:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Though the British government, from perhaps too
rigid an adherence to the law of nations, outraged as
they are by the common enemy, may, however irritated
by her conduct, display a magnanimous forbearance toward
so insignificant a Power as America, they will not,
we are persuaded, suffer our proud sovereignty of the
ocean to be mutilated by any invasion of its just rights
and prerogatives. Though the right, tacitly abandoned
for the last century, may be suffered to continue dormant,
the Americans must not flatter themselves that the
principle will be permitted to have any further extent.
In the mildness of our sway we must not suffer our sovereignty
to be rebelled against or insulted with impunity....
The sovereignty of the seas in the hands of Great
Britain is an established, legitimate sovereignty,—a sovereignty
which has been exercised on principles so equitable,
and swayed with a spirit so mild, that the most
humble of the maritime Powers have been treated as if
they were on a perfect equality with us.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>The same lofty note ran through all the “Morning
Post’s” allusions to American affairs:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A few short months of war,” said a leading article,
October 24, “would convince these desperate politicians
of the folly of measuring the strength of a rising, but
still infant and puny, nation with the colossal power of
the British empire.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “Times” declared that the Americans could
not even send an ambassador to France,—could
hardly pass to Staten Island,—without British permission.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
“Right is power sanctioned by custom,”
said the “Times;” and October 20 and 22 it joined
the “Morning Post” in denouncing the disavowal of
Berkeley. The “Morning Chronicle” alone resisted
the torrent which was sweeping away the traditions
of English honor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Government,” it said,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in support of its enemy,
Canning, “in acting with prudence and wisdom, have to
resist the pressure of a spirit not popular, like that in
America, but as violent and as ignorant, with the addition
of being in the highest degree selfish and sordid.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of the “Chesapeake” the Ministry resisted
that “selfish and sordid” interest; but Americans
soon learned that the favor, such as it was,
had been purchased at a price beyond its value.
Canning’s most brilliant stroke was for the moment
only half revealed.</p>

<p>The new Ministry which succeeded “All the Talents”
and took seat in Parliament April 8, 1807,
represented everything in English society that was
most impervious to reason. In its origin a creature
of royal bigotry trembling on the verge of insanity,
before it had been a few short weeks in office every
liberal or tolerant Englishman was shocked to find
that this band of Tories, whose prejudices were such
as modern society could scarcely understand, and who
had been forced into office by the personal will of
an almost imbecile King, did in reality represent a
great reaction of the English people against tolerant
principles, and reflected the true sense of the nation
as it had never been reflected by Grenville or Fox.
Parliament was dissolved April 27, though only four
months old; and June 22, when the “Leopard” was
firing into the “Chesapeake,” the new Parliament
met at Westminster Hall, with a ministerial majority
of more than two hundred country squires, elected on
the cry that the Church was in danger.</p>

<p>From its nominal head, this Ministry was called the
Portland administration; but its leader was Spencer
Perceval, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
mouthpiece was George Canning, the Foreign Secretary.
These two commoners—men of no special
family connection, of no estates, and little so-called
“stake in the country”—guided the aristocratic and
conservative society of England, and exaggerated its
tendencies. In modern days little is remembered of
Spencer Perceval except that he became at last one
of the long list of victims to lunatic assassins; but
for a whole generation no English Liberal mentioned
the name of the murdered prime minister without
recalling the portrait drawn by Sydney Smith in the
wittiest and keenest of his writings,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in which
Perceval was figured as living at Hampstead upon
stewed meats and claret, and walking to church every
Sunday before eleven young gentlemen of his own
begetting, with their faces washed and their hair
pleasingly combed.</p>

<p>In Sydney Smith’s caricature there was little exaggeration.
Spencer Perceval was forty-five years old,
a lawyer of the best character, devoted to his family,
his church, and sovereign; a man after Lord Eldon’s
heart, who brought to the Treasury Bench the legal
knowledge and mental habits of a leader at the Chancery
Bar and the political morality of a lawyer’s
brief. The criticism was not less revolting than remarkable,
that many of the men whose want of political
morality was most conspicuous in this story were,
both in England and in America, models of private
respectability and fanatical haters of vice. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Timothy Pickering and Roger Griswold should join
hands with Aaron Burr was less wonderful than that
Spencer Perceval and his friend James Stephen, the
author of “War in Disguise,” should adopt the violence
of Napoleon as the measure of their own
morals, and avow that they meant to respect no
other standard. With the same voice Spencer Perceval
expressed fear lest calling Parliament on a
Monday should lead members into Sunday travel, and
justified the bombardment of Copenhagen and the
robbery of American commerce.</p>

<p>The Whigs thought little of his abilities. Sydney
Smith, who delighted to ridicule him, said that he
had the head of a country parson and the tongue of
an Old Bailey lawyer.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The Tories admired and
followed him as readily as they had once followed
Pitt; but to an American, necessarily prejudiced,
Sydney Smith’s estimate seemed just. Every American
critic placed Perceval in an order of intelligence
not only below the Whigs, but below Lord Sidmouth.
When confronted with the dulness of Spencer Perceval,
Americans could even feel relief in the sarcasm
of George Canning, which, unlike Perceval’s speeches,
had at least the merit of rhetoric.</p>

<p>Of George Canning, who passed so rapidly across
the scene, and yet left so sharp an impression on the
memory of America, something must be said, if only
to explain how a man so gifted, and in later life so
different in influence, should have thought it worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
his while to challenge the hatred of a people whose
future he, unlike his colleague Perceval, had imagination
enough to foresee. George Canning was
thirty-seven years old when he took charge of the
Foreign office. His father, who came from a very
respectable but in no way eminent family, died in
1771; his mother having no means of support became
a provincial actress, and the boy was adopted by
an uncle, who sent him to Eton and Oxford. He left
Oxford at the time when the French Revolution
promised a new birth to Europe, and Canning was
then a warm Republican from sympathy and conviction.
The political reaction which followed swept
the young man to the opposite extreme; and his
vehemence for monarchy and the Tories gave point
to a Whig sarcasm,—that men had often been
known to turn their coats, but this was the first time
that a boy had turned his jacket. In consequence
of his conversion Pitt brought him into Parliament
in 1793, and placed him in office in 1796. In the
hotbed of Pitt’s personal favor<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Canning’s natural
faults were stimulated, until the irritation caused
by his sarcastic wit and by what the stolid gentry
thought his flippancy roused a sort of insurrection
against him. Few men were more admired, and none
was more feared or hated; for it was impossible to
say what time-honored monument he might overthrow
in defending.</p>

<p>No man in England flung himself more violently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
into the reaction against Republican ideas than this
young Republican of 1789. Canning’s contempt was
unbounded for everything that savored of liberal
principles; and in following the impulses of his
passion he lost whatever political morality he had possessed.
If one act in Bonaparte’s career concentrated
more than another the treason and violence of a
lifetime, it was the <i>coup d’état</i> of the 18th Brumaire,
in 1799, when he drove the Legislature at the point
of the bayonet from the hall at St. Cloud, and annihilated
French liberty, as he hoped, forever; yet this
act, which might have been applauded by some
English statesmen whose heads paid on Tower Hill
the penalty for such treason to the liberties of their
own country, threw Canning into paroxysms of
delight.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Huzza! huzza! huzza!” he wrote<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> on hearing the
news; “for no language but that of violent and tumultuous
and triumphant exclamation can sufficiently describe
the joy and satisfaction which I feel at this
complete overthrow and extinction of all the hopes of
the proselytes to new principles.... It is the lasting
ridicule thrown upon all systems of democratic equality,—it
is the galling conviction carried home to the minds
of all the brawlers for freedom in this and every other
country,—that there never was, nor will be, nor can be,
a leader of a mob faction who does not mean to be the
lord and not the servant of the people. It is this that
makes the name of Bonaparte dear to me.... Henceforth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
with regard to France and the principles of France,
or to any country similarly circumstanced as to extent,
population, manners, etc., <i>Republican</i> and <i>fool</i> are synonymous
terms.”</p>
</div>

<p>Canning had several qualities in common with
Bonaparte, and one of them was the habit of classifying
under the head of fools persons whose opinions
he did not fancy,—from the man who believed in a
republic to the man who liked dry champagne. In
his mouth such persons were either fools or liars;
and Americans, with few exceptions, came under one
or the other of these heads. After the 18th Brumaire
the world contained but one leader of a mob faction,
brawling for liberty; but he was President of the
United States. No miraculous sagacity was needed
to foretell what treatment he was likely to receive at
the hands of two men like Canning and Bonaparte,
should the empire of the world ever be divided between
them. To throw lasting ridicule upon all
systems of democratic equality was Canning’s most
passionate wish, and his success was marvellous.
Even his squibs exploded like rockets. In literature,
his “Needy Knife-grinder” was a harmless piece of
clever satire, but in the “Anti-Jacobin” it was a
political event.</p>

<p>In Parliament Canning’s influence was not yet
very great. He relied too much on wit, and what
was then called quizzing, or he imitated Pitt’s oratory
too closely; but even in the House of Commons
he steadily won ground, and while Burke, Pitt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Fox, Windham, and Sheridan, one after another, disappeared
or were thrown into the shade, Canning’s
figure became more prominent on the Treasury Bench
between two such foils as Spencer Perceval and Lord
Castlereagh. Although his mind ripened slowly, and
was still far from maturity, he was already a master
in choice of language; he always excelled in clearness
of statement and skill of illustration; and if his
taste had been as pure as his English, he would have
taken rank with the greatest English orators. Some
of his metaphors survived, with those of Burke and
Sheridan. When Napoleon was forced back to the
Elbe, “the mighty deluge, by which the Continent had
been overwhelmed, began to subside; the limits of
nations were again visible; and the spires and turrets
of ancient establishments began to reappear above
the subsiding wave.” In addressing the people at
Plymouth, he likened England to a line-of-battle
ship; “one of those stupendous masses now reposing
on their shadows in perfect stillness,” but ready at
a sign to ruffle, as it were, its swelling plumage,
to awaken its dormant thunder. Such eloquence
recalled Burke at his less philosophical moments. It
contained more rhetoric than thought; but Canning
was there at his best. At his worst, as Americans
commonly saw him, his natural tones seemed artificial,
and only his imitations seemed natural. To
Americans Canning never showed himself except as
an actor. As an instance of his taste, Americans
could best appreciate the climax with which he once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
electrified the House of Commons in speaking of the
Spanish American Republics: “I called the new
world into existence to redress the balance of the
old.” The House cheered to the echo, while America
stood open-mouthed in astonishment at the success of
such extravagant egoism.</p>

<p>In the new Ministry of 1807, the lead was to the
strongest; and Canning, who treated with almost
open contempt his rival Lord Castlereagh, a man
intellectually his inferior, could count upon a great
destiny. Less scrupulous or less broad than Pitt,
he held that Napoleon’s course had absolved England
from ordinary rules of morals. To fight Bonaparte
with his own weapons had become the duty of
Englishmen; and the first act of the new Administration
showed what meaning was to be put on this
favorite phrase.</p>

<p>February 8, Napoleon fought the desperate battle of
Eylau, which closely resembled a defeat. His position
was critical; but before Canning could fairly get
control of events, Napoleon, June 14, again attacked
the Russians at Friedland and won a decisive victory.
June 25 Napoleon and Alexander held an interview
on an island in the Niemen. The chief point in question
was whether Alexander would abandon England;
and this he was almost glad to do, for England had
abandoned him. Alexander yielded to the force and
flattery of Napoleon, and signed July 7 the treaty of
Tilsit. By a private understanding the remaining
neutrals were left to Napoleon to be dealt with as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
pleased. Denmark was the only neutral power the
control of which was necessary for the success of
Napoleon’s system, and August 2 he sent orders
to Bernadotte, who was to command at Hamburg:
“If England does not accept the mediation of Russia,
Denmark must declare war upon her, or I will declare
war on Denmark.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Finding that the Prince
Royal hesitated, Napoleon, August 17, sent orders<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
to Bernadotte to hold himself ready with all his
troops to march into Denmark either as ally or
enemy, according to the issue of the pending negotiation.
Threatened by this overwhelming danger,
the Prince Royal of Denmark alternately promised
and evaded the declaration of war; when suddenly
his doubts were brought to an end by the diplomacy
of Canning.</p>

<p>The British ministry had been secretly informed of
what took place at Tilsit, and even without secret information
could not have doubted the fate of Denmark.
Vigor was necessary; and as early as July 19, before
news had arrived of the formal signature of the Tilsit
treaty, the Cabinet decided on sending to Copenhagen
a large naval expedition which had been collected
for a different purpose. July 26 the expedition, commanded
by Lord Gambier, sailed from the Downs.
It consisted of some twenty ships of the line, forty
frigates, and transports containing twenty-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
thousand troops commanded by Lord Cathcart; and
it carried a diplomatic agent with instructions to require
from the Prince Royal of Denmark the delivery
of the Danish fleet, as a temporary security for the
safety of England.</p>

<p>The man whom Canning charged with this unpleasant
duty was the same Jackson whose appointment
as Minister to the United States had
been opposed by Rufus King, and who had subsequently
gone as British minister to Berlin. Jackson’s
dogmatic temper and overbearing manners made him
obnoxious even to the clerks of the Foreign Office;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
but he was a favorite with Lord Malmesbury, who
since Pitt’s death had become Canning’s political
mentor, and Lord Malmesbury’s influence was freely
used in Jackson’s behalf. Obeying his instructions,
the British envoy went to Kiel and had an interview
with the Prince Royal early in August, at about
the time when Napoleon issued his first orders to
Bernadotte. The Prince could only refuse with indignation
Jackson’s demand, and sent orders to Copenhagen
to prepare for attack. He was in the situation
of Barron on the “Chesapeake.” Copenhagen had
hardly a gun in position, and no troops to use in
defence.</p>

<p>The British demand was in itself insulting enough,
but Jackson’s way of presenting it was said to have
been peculiarly offensive, and London soon rang with
stories of his behavior to the unfortunate Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Royal.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Even the King of England seemed to think
that his agent needed rebuke. Lord Eldon, who was
one of the advisers and most strenuous supporters
of the attack on Copenhagen,—although he said
in private that the story made his heart ache and
his blood run cold,—used to relate,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> on the authority
of old King George himself, that when Jackson was
presented at Court on his return from Copenhagen
the King abruptly asked him, “Was the Prince
Royal upstairs or down, when he received you?”
“He was on the ground floor,” replied Jackson.
“I am glad of it! I am glad of it!” rejoined the old
King; “for if he had half the spirit of his uncle
George III., he would infallibly have kicked you
downstairs.” The Prince did not kick Mr. Jackson,
though the world believed he had reason to do so,
but he declined to accept the British envoy’s remark
that in war the weak must submit to the strong;
and Lord Gambier landed twenty thousand men, established
batteries, and for three days and nights,
from September 1 to September 5, bombarded Copenhagen.
The city was neither invested nor assaulted
nor intended to be occupied; it was merely destroyed,
little by little,—as a bandit would cut off first an
ear, then the nose, then a finger of his victim, to
hasten payment of a ransom. At the end of the
third day’s bombardment, when at last the Danish
ships were delivered, the bodies of near two thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
non-combatants lay buried in the smoking ruins of
about one half the city. At the same time all the
Danish merchant-vessels in English waters, with their
cargoes, to the value of ten million dollars, were
seized and confiscated; while the Danish factory in
Bengal was, without warning, swept into England’s
pouch.</p>

<p>At the news of the awful tragedy at Copenhagen,
Europe, gorged as for fifteen years she had been
with varied horrors, shuddered from St. Petersburg
to Cadiz. A long wail of pity and despair rose on
the Continent, was echoed back from America, and
found noble expression in the British Parliament.
The attack upon the “Chesapeake” was a caress of
affection compared with this bloody and brutal deed.
As in 1804 Bonaparte—then only First Consul, but
about to make himself a bastard Emperor—flung before
the feet of Europe the bloody corpse of the Duc
d’Enghien, so George Canning in 1807, about to
meet Bonaparte on his own field with his own
weapons, called the world to gaze at his handiwork
in Copenhagen; and the world then contained but
a single nation to which the fate of Copenhagen spoke
in accents of direct and instant menace. The annihilation
of Denmark left America almost the only
neutral, as she had long been the only Republican
State. In both characters her offences against Canning
and Perceval, Castlereagh and Eldon, had been
more serious than those of Denmark, and had roused
to exasperation the temper of England. A single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
ship of the line, supported by one or two frigates,
could without a moment’s notice repeat at New
York the tragedy which had required a vast armament
at Copenhagen; and the assault on the “Chesapeake”
had given warning of what the British navy
stood ready to do. Other emphatic omens were not
wanting.</p>

<p>About July 27—the day after Lord Gambier’s
fleet sailed from the Downs, and the day when Monroe
first saw in the newspapers an account of the
“Leopard’s” attack on the “Chesapeake”—the
American minister might have read a report made
by a committee of the House of Commons on the
commercial state of the West Indian Islands. The
main evil, said the committee,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> was the very unfavorable
state of the foreign market, in which the British
merchant formerly enjoyed nearly a monopoly.
“The result of all their inquiries on this most important
part of the subject has brought before their eyes
one grand and primary evil from which all the others
are easily to be deduced; namely, the facility of intercourse
between the hostile colonies and Europe under
the American neutral flag, by means of which
not only the whole of their produce is carried to a
market, but at charges little exceeding those of
peace, while the British planter is burdened with
all the inconvenience, risk, and expense resulting
from a state of war.” To correct this evil, a blockade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
of the enemies’ colonies had been suggested;
“and such a measure, if it could be strictly enforced,
would undoubtedly afford relief to our export trade.
But a measure of more permanent and certain advantage
would be the enforcement of those restrictions
on the trade between neutrals and the enemies’
colonies which were formerly maintained
by Great Britain, and from the relaxation of which
the enemies’ colonies obtain indirectly, during war,
all the advantages of peace.”</p>

<p>In its way this West Indian Report was stamped
with the same Napoleonic character as the bombardment
of Copenhagen or the assault on the “Chesapeake;”
in a parliamentary manner it admitted that
England, with all her navy, could not enforce a blockade
by lawful means, and therefore it had become “a
matter of evident and imperious necessity” that she
should turn pirate. The true sense of the recommendation
was neither doubted nor disputed in England,
except as matter of parliamentary form. That the
attempt to cut off the supply of French and Spanish
sugar from Europe, either by proclaiming a paper
blockade or the Rule of 1756, might result in war
with the United States was conceded, and no one in
private denied that America in such a case had just
cause for war. The evidence upon which the Report
founded its conclusion largely dealt with the probable
effect on the colonies of a war with the United States;
and the Report itself, in language only so far veiled
as to be decent, intimated that although war would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
be essentially detrimental to the islands it would not
be fatal, and would be better than their actual condition.
The excuse for what every reasonable Englishman
frankly avowed to be “a system of piracy,”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
was that the West Indian colonies must perish without
it, and England must share their fate. In vain
did less terrified men, like Alexander Baring or
William Spence, preach patience, explaining that the
true difficulty with the West Indies was an overproduction
of sugar, with which the Americans had
nothing to do.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To charge the distresses of the West Indian planters
upon the American carriers,” said Spence,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> “is almost
as absurd as it would be for the assassin to lay the blame
of murder upon the arsenic which he had purposely
placed in the sugar-dish of his friend.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus Parliament, Ministry, navy, colonies, the shipping
and the landed interest of England had wrought
public opinion to the point of war with the United
States at the moment when Lord Gambier bombarded
Copenhagen and the “Leopard” fired into the “Chesapeake.”
The tornado of prejudice and purposeless
rage which broke into expression on the announcement
that a British frigate had fired into an American,
surpassed all experience. The English newspapers
for the year that followed the “Chesapeake”
affair seemed irrational, the drunkenness of power
incredible. The Americans, according to the “Morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Post” of Jan. 14, 1808, “possess all the vices of
their Indian neighbors without their virtues;” and
two days afterward the same newspaper—which
gave tone to the country press—declared that England
was irresistible: “Our vigor and energy have
just reached that sublime pitch from which their
weight must crush all opposition.”</p>

<p>No one could say for how much of this extravagance
Canning was directly responsible; but the
tone of the press was certainly an echo of the tone
he had so long taken, and which he stimulated.
That he was really so reckless as he seemed need not
be imagined; although eighteen months afterward,
Lord Grenville with the utmost emphasis said in
the House of Lords,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> “I do firmly believe that it is
the object of his Majesty’s ministers to do everything
in their power to force America into hostility with
this country.” Lord Grenville occasionally exaggerated,
and he was probably mistaken in this instance;
but he found it possible to believe ministers capable
of acting with the motive he charged on them. In
truth he had strong ground for the opinion he held,
which was by no means peculiar to him. As early
as July 27, 1807, the “Morning Chronicle,” in announcing
the first news of the “Chesapeake” affair,
added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We trust it is of a nature to be adjusted without that
most ruinous of all follies yet left us to be guilty of,—an
American war. We have rather more fear than hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
however on the subject, when we reflect that the present
ministers are of those who consider an American war as
rather desirable.”</p>
</div>

<p>Within a short time the “Morning Post” avowed
and proclaimed, in articles evidently inspired by
Government, the wish for war with America:<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A war of a very few months, without creating to us
the expense of a single additional ship, would be sufficient
to convince her of her folly by a necessary chastisement
of her insolence and audacity.”</p>
</div>

<p>In January, 1808, the same newspaper spoke even
more plainly:<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For us, we have always been of the opinion that in
the present temper of the American government no relations
of amity can be maintained with that nation unless
at the expense of our dearest rights and most essential
interests.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps this tone was taken partly with the idea of
terrifying the Americans into obedience; but beyond
question a strong party leaned to violence. Monroe,
who had the best means of knowing, felt no doubts
on this point, and warned the President of the danger
to the United States.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There has been,” he wrote Aug. 4, 1807,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> “at all
times since the commencement of the present war, a
strong party here for extending its ravages to them.
This party is composed of the shipowners, the navy, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
East and West India merchants, and certain political
characters of great consideration in the State. So
powerful is this combination that it is most certain
that nothing can be obtained of the government on
any point but what may be extorted by necessity.”</p>
</div>

<p>Insane as such a policy might seem, Lord Grenville’s
charge against ministers had solid ground.</p>

<p>Special interests were commonly blind to the general
good. That the navy, the mercantile marine,
and the colonies should have favored war with America
was not surprising; but that the mania should
have seized upon the English nation at large was a
phenomenon to be explained only by general causes.
The true explanation was not far to seek; the secret,
if secret it could be called, was the inevitable result
of Jefferson’s passion for peace,—social and political
contempt. This feeling was unbounded, pervading
all parties and all classes, and finding expression
in the most gross as in the simplest and least intentional
forms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Hatred of America,” said one of the numerous British
pamphleteers of the time,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> “seems a prevailing sentiment
in this country. Whether it be that they have no
crown and nobility, and are on this account not quite a
<i>genteel</i> Power; or that their manners are less polished
than our own; or that we grudge their independence,
and hanker after our old monopoly of their trade; or
that they closely resemble us in language, character, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
laws; or finally, that it is more our interest to live well
with them than with any other nation in the world,—the
fact is undeniable that the bulk of the people would fain
be at war with them.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Somersetshire squire and the chancery barrister
in Westminster Hall—the extremes of national
obtuseness and professional keenness—agreed in despising
America. The pompous Lord Sidmouth, the
tedious Lord Sheffield, the vivacious Canning, the
religious Perceval, and the merry-andrew Cobbett—whose
genius was peculiar in thinking itself popular—joined
hands in spreading libels against a people
three thousand miles away, who according to their
own theory were too contemptible to be dangerous.
Except a few Whig noblemen, a number of Yorkshire
and Lancashire manufacturers and a great mass
of the laboring people, or American merchants like
the Barings, and one or two Scotch Liberals who
wrote in the “Edinburgh Review,” the English public
had but one voice against Americans. Young Henry
Brougham, not yet thirty years old, whose restless
mind persistently asked questions which parsons and
squires thought absurd or impious, speculated much
upon the causes of this prejudice. Was it because
the New York dinners were less elegant than those
of London, or because the Yankees talked with an
accent, or because their manners were vulgar? No
doubt a prejudice might seize on any justification,
however small; but a prejudice so general and so
deep became respectable, and needed a correct explanation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
The British nation was sometimes slow-witted,
and often narrow-minded, but was not insane.</p>

<p>For a thousand years every step in the progress of
England had been gained by sheer force of hand
and will. In the struggle for existence the English
people, favored by situation, had grown into a new
human type,—which might be brutal, but was not
weak; which had little regard for theory, but an
immense and just respect for facts. America considered
herself to be a serious fact, and expected
England to take her at her own estimate of her
own value; but this was more than could reasonably
be asked. England required America to prove by
acts what virtue existed in her conduct or character
which should exempt her from the common lot of
humanity, or should entitle her to escape the tests
of manhood,—the trials, miseries, and martyrdoms
through which the character of mankind had thus
far in human history taken, for good or bad, its vigorous
development. England had never learned to
strike soft in battle. She expected her antagonists
to fight; and if they would not fight, she took them
to be cowardly or mean. Jefferson and his government
had shown over and over again that no
provocation would make them fight; and from the
moment that this attitude was understood, America
became fair prey. Jefferson had chosen his own
methods of attack and defence; but he could not
require England or France to respect them before
they had been tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>Contempt for America was founded on belief in
American cowardice; but beneath the disdain lurked
an uneasy doubt which gave to contempt the virulence
of fear. The English nation, and especially
the aristocracy, believed that America was biding her
time; that she expected to become a giant; and that
if she succeeded, she would use her strength as every
other giant in the world’s history had done before
her. The navy foresaw a day when American fleets
might cover the ocean. The merchant dreaded competition
with Yankee shrewdness, for he well knew
the antiquated processes, the time-honored percentages,
the gross absurdities of English trade, the
abuses of the custom-house, the clumsiness and extravagance
of government. The shipowners had
even more cause for alarm. Already the American
ship was far in advance of the British model,—a
swifter and more economical sailer, more heavily
sparred and more daringly handled. In peace competition
had become difficult, until the British ship-owner
cried for war; yet he already felt, without
acknowledging it even to himself, that in war he
was likely to enjoy little profit or pleasure on the day
when the long, low, black hull of the Yankee privateer,
with her tapering, bending spars, her long-range
gun, and her sharp-faced captain, should appear
on the western horizon, and suddenly, at sight
of the heavy lumbering British merchantman, should
fling out her white wings of canvas and fly down
on her prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Contempt, mingled with vague alarm, was at the
bottom of England’s conduct toward America; and
whatever the swarm of newspaper statesmen might
say or think, the element of alarm was so great that
the Tory ministers, although they might expect war,
did not want it, and hoped to prevent it by the very
boldness of their policy. Even Canning was cautious
enough to prefer not to give America occasion for
learning her strength. He meant to clip her wings
only so far as she would submit to have her wings
clipped; and he not only astonished but disgusted
the over-zealous politicians who applauded Admiral
Berkeley, by disavowing the admiral’s doctrines of
international law and recalling the admiral himself.
The war faction broke into a paroxysm of rage<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> when
this decision became known, and for a time Canning
seemed likely to be devoured by his own hounds, so
vociferous was their outcry. Monroe and Pinkney
were loud in praise of Canning’s and Perceval’s temperate
and candid behavior.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Canning was obliged to defend himself, and under
his promptings a long reply to his critics was written
for the “Morning Post,”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>—a newspaper version
of the instructions carried by his special minister to
Washington. He excused his treatment of Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Berkeley on the ground that lawyers recognized no
right of search in national ships. The excuse was
evidently feeble. The law, or at least the lawyers,
of England had hitherto justified every act which
the government had chosen to commit,—the seizure
of the Spanish treasure-ships in 1804, accompanied
by the unnecessary destruction of hundreds of
lives; the secret seizure of the larger part of American
commerce in 1805, by collusion with the Admiralty
judges; the paper blockade of Charles James
Fox in 1806; the Order in Council of January, 1807,
by which Lord Howick cut off another main branch
of neutral commerce with which England had no
legal right to interfere; finally, the lawyers justified
the bombardment of Copenhagen as an act of necessary
defence, and were about to justify a general control
of all neutral commerce as an act of retaliation.
To suppose that law so elastic, or lawyers with minds
so fertile, could discover no warrant for Berkeley’s
act was preposterous. To neutral commerce England
had no legal right; yet she took it, and her lawyers
invented a title. To her citizens and seamen she actually
had a legal right, recognized by every court in
Christendom; and if after a fair demand on the neutral
government she found that her right could be
satisfied only by violating neutral jurisdiction, the
lawyers, in view of all their other decisions, must
hold that such violation was a matter of expediency
and not of law. Canning’s critics in reply to his
assertion that the lawyers would recognize no right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of search in national ships, could fairly say that he
was alone to blame,—he should have ordered them
to find it. George Canning could not seriously propose
to sacrifice a vital English interest in obedience
to the scrupulous legal morality of Spencer Perceval,
Lord Eldon, Sir William Scott, and Sir Vicary
Gibbs.</p>

<p>In truth, Canning had reasons more forcible. With
a character not unlike that which Dryden ascribed to
Lord Shaftesbury, he was pleased with the danger
when the waves ran high; and if he steered too near
the shoals in order to prove his wit, he did not wish
to run the vessel ashore. He disavowed Admiral
Berkeley, not because the lawyers were unable to
prove whatever the government required, but because
the right of searching foreign ships-of-war was not
worth asserting, and would cost more than it could
ever bring in return. Besides this obvious reason,
he was guided by another motive which would alone
have turned the scale. Perceval had invented a
scheme for regulating neutral commerce. This measure
had begun to take a character so stern that even
its author expected it to produce war with the United
States; and if war could be avoided at all, it could be
avoided only by following Erskine’s advice, and by
sending to America, before the new Orders in Council,
an apology for the attack on the “Chesapeake.”</p>

</div>


<p>The Orders in Council of Nov. 11, 1807, gave an
impulse so energetic to the history of the United
States; they worked so effectually to drive America
into a new path, and to break the power and blot
out the memory of Virginia and Massachusetts principles,—that
every detail of their history was important.
Englishmen were little likely to dwell on
acts of which even at the time England was at heart
ashamed, and which she afterward remembered with
astonishment. To Americans alone the statesmanship
of Spencer Perceval and George Canning was a
matter of so much interest as to deserve study.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1806 American merchants
might, as always before, send cargoes of West Indian
produce to any port on the continent not blockaded,
provided they could satisfy British cruisers and
courts that the cargo was in good faith neutral,—not
French or Spanish property disguised. Jan. 7,
1807, Lord Howick issued the Order in Council
which, under pretence of retaliation for Napoleon’s
Berlin Decree, cut off the coasting rights of neutrals.
After that time the American merchant might still
send a ship to Bordeaux; but if the ship, finding no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
market at Bordeaux, should resume her voyage, and
make for Amsterdam or the Mediterranean, she became
fair prize. Something has been already said<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
upon the character of Lord Howick’s order, and on
the subsequent debate in Parliament, when, February
4, Spencer Perceval attacked the Whig ministry
for not carrying the principle of retaliation far
enough. Two objects were to be gained, said Perceval<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
from the opposition bench: the first and
greatest was to counteract the enemy’s measures
and protect English trade; the second was to distress
France. Howick’s order neither did nor could
effect either object; and Perceval called for a measure
which should shut out colonial produce from
France and Spain altogether, unless it came from
England and had paid a duty at a British custom-house
to enhance the price. If Lord Howick’s principle
of retaliation was good for anything, Perceval
contended it was good to this extent; and as for
neutrals, there was no necessity for consulting them,—all
they could reasonably expect was a notice.</p>

<p>The Whigs naturally replied to Perceval that before
further punishing America for the acts of France,
America should be allowed time to assert her own
rights. This suggestion called out Lord Castlereagh,
who frequently spoke the truth in ways inconvenient
to his colleagues and amusing to his enemies. In
this instance he admitted and even accented a point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
which became afterward the strongest part of the
American argument. He ridiculed the idea of waiting
for America to act, because notoriously the Berlin
Decree had not been enforced against American
commerce:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is one ground why we should look upon America
with jealousy. It is an aggravation that she has, by
a secret understanding with the French government, contrived
to take her shipping out of the operation of the
decree, that was at first general, and placed herself in a
situation of connivance with the French government.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few weeks afterward Perceval and Castlereagh
took office. One of their first acts set on foot a parliamentary
inquiry into the state of West Indian commerce.
The report of this committee, presented
to the House July 27, was ordered to be printed
August 8. August 10 the House voted to take it into
consideration early in the next session; and four days
afterward Parliament was prorogued, leaving ministers
to deal at their leisure with the “Chesapeake”
affair, the Danish fleet, and Napoleon’s attempts to
exclude English manufactures and commerce from
Europe.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s Berlin Decree of Nov. 21, 1806, had
remained till then almost a dead letter. The underwriters
at Lloyds, alarmed at first by the seizures
made under that decree, recovered courage between
April and August, 1807, so far as to insure at low
rates neutral vessels bound to Holland and Hamburg.
This commerce attracted Napoleon’s notice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
August 19 he threatened his brother Louis, King of
Holland, to send thirty thousand troops into his kingdom
if the ports were not shut;<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> August 24 he sent
positive orders<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> that his decree of Berlin should be
executed in Holland; and in the last days of August
news reached London that a general seizure of neutral
vessels had taken place at Amsterdam.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> From
that moment no ship could obtain insurance, and
trade with the Continent ceased. Soon afterward the
American ship “Horizon” was condemned by the
French courts under the Berlin Decree, and no one
could longer doubt that the favor hitherto extended
to American commerce had also ceased.</p>

<p>These dates were important, because upon them
hung the popular defence of Perceval’s subsequent
Orders in Council. No argument in favor of these
orders carried so much weight in England as the
assertion that America had acquiesced in Napoleon’s
Berlin Decree. The President had in fact submitted
to the announcement of Napoleon’s blockade, as he
had submitted to Sir William Scott’s decisions, Lord
Howick’s Order in Council, the blockade of New
York, and the custom of impressment, without effectual
protest; but the Berlin Decree was not enforced
against American commerce until about Sept. 1, 1807,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and no one in America knew of the enforcement, or
could have acted upon it, before the British government
took the law into its own hands.</p>

<p>The month of September passed, and the British
ministry was sufficiently busy with the bombardment
of Copenhagen and the assault on the “Chesapeake,”
without touching neutral trade; but October 1 Lord
Castlereagh wrote a letter<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> to Perceval, urging retaliation
upon France in order to make her feel that Napoleon’s
anti-commercial system was useless, and in
order to assert for future guidance the general principle
that England would reject any peace which did
not bring commerce with it. The idea presented by
Castlereagh was clear and straightforward,—the
double-or-quits of a gambler; and however open to
the charge of ignorance or violence, it was not mean
or dishonest.</p>

<p>In reply Perceval drew up a paper of suggestions<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
for the use of the Cabinet, dealing first with the justice,
next with the policy of retaliation. Of its justice
as against France he thought there could be no doubt,
while Lord Howick’s order had already asserted the
principle as against neutrals, even before it could be
known whether neutrals would retaliate on their own
account; but apart from this precedent, “the injury
which neutrals sustain is consequential; the measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
is not adopted with a view to injure the neutrals, but
to injure the enemy.” Perhaps Perceval felt that this
argument might lead too far, and that on such a doctrine
England might appropriate the world on every
declaration of war; for in the next paragraph he
pleaded the particular war in which England was
actually engaged as his warranty:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When an enemy arises who declares to all the world
that he will trample upon the law of nations, and hold at
nought all the privileges of neutral nations when they do
not suit his belligerent interests; and when by the great
extent of his power he is enabled in great measure to act
up to his declaration,—it is evident that if those Powers
with which he is at war should continue to hold themselves
bound to rules and obligations of which he will not
acknowledge the force, they cannot carry on the contest
on equal terms. And the neutral who would control their
hostility by those rules and laws which their enemy refuses
to recognize, and which such neutral does not
compel that enemy to observe, ceases to be a neutral by
ceasing to observe that impartiality which is the very life
and soul of neutrality.”</p>
</div>

<p>This allegation differed from the first. Perceval
began by maintaining that England possessed a right,
if she chose, to suppress the existence of America
or of any other neutral, provided the suppression
were consequential on an intent to injure France.
He next argued that the existence of America might
be equally suppressed because she had not yet succeeded
in compelling France to observe neutral privileges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
which so far as she was concerned had not been
violated. If these two propositions were worth making,
they should have settled the question. Yet Perceval
was not satisfied; he took a third ground:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This question, however, need not now be argued to
the extent which was necessary to justify the assertion
of the late Government; because whatever might be the
doubts upon it when the decree of France first issued,
and before it was known to what extent neutrals would
resist or acquiesce in it, since those neutrals have acquiesced
in it, or at least have not resisted or resented it to
the extent of obtaining a formal recall of the decree and
an open renunciation of the principle which dictated it,
nor the abandonment of the practices which flow from it,—they
by their acquiescence and submission have given
to Great Britain a right to expect from them (when her
interests require the exertion of measures of correspondent
efficacy) a forbearance similar to that which they
have shown toward her enemy.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Perceval’s two opening premises gave a strange
idea of English statesmanship, his third was little
creditable to the English bar. He took the ground
that England might do what she would with American
commerce, because America, whatever effort she
might have made, had not already forced Napoleon to
recall a decree from the application of which the
United States notoriously had till within six weeks
been exempted. Lord Castlereagh’s doctrine that
America’s exemption aggravated her offence was a
wide-minded argument by the side of Perceval’s assertion
that America’s acquiescence was proved by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
French decree itself. Considering that America had
in this sense acquiesced in Sir William Scott’s decisions
and the wholesale confiscation of her commerce,
in the impressment of her native citizens and
their compulsory service in the British navy, in the
blockade of New York, in Fox’s paper blockade of
the German coast, in Lord Howick’s Order in Council,
and perhaps even in the “Chesapeake” outrage,—Perceval’s
argument must have seemed convincing to
Napoleon, if not to President Jefferson. If the law
of nations thus laid down was sound, the continued
presence of American citizens in British ships of
war was alone sufficient proof of American acquiescence
in impressment to warrant Napoleon in acting
without regard to neutral rights. From a neutral
or French point of view Perceval’s reasoning not
only conceded the legality of the Berlin Decree, but
barred his own right of retaliation, since England, as
the first and worst offender, could not properly
profit by her own misdeeds.</p>

<p>There Perceval rested his case, so far as concerned
the law. His three grounds were—(1) That
as a neutral the United States could complain of no
retaliation between belligerents, unless this retaliation
was avowedly adopted with a view to injure neutrals;
(2) That America ceased to be a neutral from
the moment that she wished England to observe
rules which France refused to recognize, and which
America did not at once compel France to recognize;
and (3) That the continued existence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
recent enforcement of the Berlin Decree were sufficient
proof of the neutral’s acquiescence.</p>

<p>Thus a measure of vital consequence to England
was proposed to the Cabinet on grounds which would
hardly have been sufficient to warrant an injunction
to restrain a private nuisance. So far as argument
was concerned, Perceval had no more to say.
Having in his opinion established his legal right
to do what he pleased with American commerce,
he next discussed the policy and extent of the proposed
interference. His first idea was comparatively
moderate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we actually prohibit all intercourse between neutrals
and the enemies’ colonies,” he continued, “or
between neutrals and the enemies’ continental possessions,
it would be such a severe blow upon the trade of
America as might make it no unreasonable choice on her
part to prefer the dangers and chances of war to such a
restriction upon her trade. I should therefore wish to
leave such advantages still to neutral trade as to make it
quite clear to be the policy of America, if she is wise, to
prefer the neutral trade that will be left to her to the
total stoppage of her trade with the enemy and with
ourselves which a war might occasion.... With this
view, therefore, I would recommend to relax thus far in
the rigor of our retaliatory prohibitions as to leave to
neutral nations the right of trading <i>directly</i> in articles of
their own growth, produce, and manufacture exported
in their own vessels to enemies’ countries, and of importing
from the enemies’ countries for their own use articles
the growth, produce, and manufacture of such enemies’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
countries; that is, leaving to them free the <i>direct</i> trade
between the enemy and themselves in articles of their
respective growth, etc., but to prohibit the re-exportation
of any articles the growth, etc., of the enemies’
countries or their colonies, or the carriage of them to
any other country but their own.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perceval’s first suggestion was far from being so
radical as the measure at last adopted. He proposed
to cut off France from her colonies and force
all trade between those colonies and Europe to pass
through British hands; but an American ship laden
with American cotton or wheat might still sail from
the United States direct to France and return to
the United States, or might carry provisions and
lumber to Martinique and Cuba, carrying French
or Spanish sugar back to New York. This so-called
“direct” trade was to be untouched; the
“indirect” or carrying trade between the West Indies
and the continent of Europe was to be permitted
only under special licenses to be issued by
British authorities.</p>

<p>In this shape Perceval sent his suggestions to the
Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, who gave
his entire approval to the principle of retaliation as
against France, but wished to retaliate against France
alone:<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> “Considering the unpopularity which, it cannot
be denied, we are held in throughout the Continent,
I very much doubt whether we should limit
this intercourse beyond the actual dominions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
France. I am well aware that by admitting the intercourse
with Holland and Spain, France will obtain
circuitously those supplies which she will stand in
want of.”</p>

<p>This disadvantage, the Duke thought, could be
largely compensated by a rigid observance of the
navigation laws. The Duke’s opinion was very short,
and barely hinted at the American question.</p>

<p>John Fane, Earl of Westmoreland, Lord Privy
Seal,—<i>Sot Privé</i>, or Privy Fool, as Canning afterward
nicknamed him by a pun on the French word
<i>sceau</i>,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>—gave next his written opinion on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Going beyond either Perceval or Portland, he
urged the expediency of stopping all trade with the
enemy except through the medium of England,—“the
effect of which must be either to distress them
to such a degree as to induce a relaxation of their
decrees, or to cause a great trade from this country.
Its effect in case of an extension of hostility can certainly
not be ascertained; but I am disposed to think
that we cannot carry on war allowing our enemy
advantages of commerce as in peace, and that if we
only do what is right we must take our chance for
the consequences.”</p>

<p>The next opinion was apparently that of Lord
Hawkesbury, the Home Secretary, who was also clear
that Perceval’s plan wanted energy. While supporting
the Duke of Portland in narrowing its scope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to France, or at the utmost to Holland, he favored
harsher treatment of America:<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I incline strongly to the opinion that it is expedient
to put an end, as far as in us lies, to all intercourse by
sea between neutrals and the continental dominions of
France, and possibly of Holland. I am satisfied that
the measure of retaliation as proposed in the enclosed
paper would have no other effect than to raise the
price of colonial produce in France to a small degree.
It would offend neutrals, particularly the Americans,
and inflict no adequate injury upon the enemy. But if
we should determine to prevent all intercourse whatever
with the ports of France except by British license, we
should have it in our power to destroy at once all the
remaining commerce of France, which by means of neutrals
is not inconsiderable, and to strike a most important
blow against her agriculture by preventing the exportation
of her wines.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Hawkesbury kept in view the retaliatory character
of the measure as a punishment of France. Lord
Castlereagh, the Secretary for War, was not quite so
careful.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> He acquiesced in Perceval’s scheme, provided
it should reserve the right to extend its own
application whenever the balance of advantage should
favor the extension; but he added,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am of opinion that some decisive measure, in vindication
of our own commerce and in counteraction of
the unsocial system of France,—the principle of which
is not the growth of this war, but was acted upon by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
her throughout the late short peace,—is become indispensable,
not merely as a measure of commercial policy,
but in order to put the contest in which we are engaged
upon its true grounds in the view of our own people
and of the world. It is no longer a struggle for territory
or for a point of honor, but whether the existence
of England as a naval power is compatible with that of
France.”</p>
</div>

<p>Avowing that a commercial transaction was his
object, and that the punishment of France was secondary
to a “vindication of our own commerce,” Castlereagh
assumed that punishment of France and
“vindication” of English commerce were both belligerent
rights, as though the right to kill an adversary
in a duel implied the right to pick a bystander’s
pocket. His colleague and rival Canning was not so
confused, for Canning’s duties obliged him to defend
the new policy against neutral objections. Carefully
as the other ministers mingled the ideas of retaliation
and of commerce, the double motive of Perceval’s
measure had never been concealed; the intention to
permit a licensed trade with France was avowed.
Perceval and Castlereagh wanted, not to take commerce
from France, but to force commerce upon her;
and none of their colleagues could detect this inconsistency
so readily as Canning, whose duties would
oblige him to assert before the world that retaliation
alone was the object of a measure which he privately
knew to have no motive but that of commercial
rivalry. Canning’s written opinion, beginning by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
affirming in strong terms the right and justice of
retaliation, continued as follows:<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The question of policy is all that remains; and in
this view I should think all such modifications as go
to lighten the burden imposed upon neutrals, and as
are obviously intended for that purpose, more advisable
than any direct reservations for our own interest
and advantage. For this reason I would rather confine
the measure to a part of the countries in the occupation
of the enemy (a large part to be sure,—France and
Holland, for instance), and apply it in all its rigor to
that part, than extend it to the whole and relax it generally
by complicated exceptions and regulations. And
I would keep out of sight the exceptions in favor of ships
going from this country, the benefit of which might be
equally obtained by licenses; but the <i>publication</i> of that
exception would give to the measure the air of a commercial
rather than a political transaction.”</p>
</div>

<p>By the end of October all the Cabinet opinions were
in Perceval’s hands, and he began the task of drafting
the proposed orders. His original draft<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> contained an
elaborate preamble, asserting that Napoleon’s decrees
violated the laws of nations, which Perceval broadly
maintained were binding on one belligerent only when
the obligation was reciprocally acknowledged by the
other; that neutrals had not resented and resisted
the outrage, “nor interposed with effect for obtaining
the revocation of those orders, but on the contrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the same have been recently reinforced;” that
Lord Howick’s retaliatory order had served only to
encourage Napoleon’s attempts; that his Majesty had
a right to declare all the dominions of France and her
allies in a state of blockade; but “not forgetting the
interests of neutral nations, and still desirous of retaliating
upon the commerce of his enemies with as
little prejudice to those interests” as was consistent
with his purpose, he would for the present prohibit
only trade which neutrals might be disposed to
pursue in submission to the French decrees, and
require that such trade should pass to or from some
British port.</p>

<p>Then followed the order, which prohibited all
neutral trade with the whole European sea-coast
from Copenhagen to Trieste, leaving only the Baltic
open. No American vessel should be allowed to enter
any port in Europe from which British vessels were
excluded, unless the American should clear from
some British port under regulations to be prescribed
at a future time.</p>

<p>This draft was completed in the first days of
November, and was sent to Lord Bathurst, President
of the Board of Trade, who mercilessly criticised the
preamble, and treated his colleague’s law with as
little respect as though Bathurst were an American.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wish the principle of retaliation,” wrote Lord
Bathurst, “not to be unqualifiedly advanced, for which
I think there is no necessity. May it not be said that
in a contest with an unprincipled enemy the doctrine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
retaliation is one dangerous to admit without qualifications?
I own I do not like the word. If my enemy
commits an act of injustice, I am not therefore justified
in committing the same, except so far as may be necessary,
in consequence of his act, either to protect myself
from injury, or prevent a recurrence to, or continuance
in, such acts of injustice. All operations of war are
justified only on the principle of defence. Retaliation
seems to admit something of a vindictive spirit.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Board of Trade was not usually scrupulous
in dealing with American commerce; but in this
instance Earl Bathurst let it be plainly seen that he
wished to have no share of responsibility for Perceval’s
casuistry. The longer he studied the proposed
order the less he liked it; and in the end he wrote
an opinion contrary to his first. He withdrew his
assent to the order altogether, and hinted some unpleasant
truths in regard to it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our ability to continue the war,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> “depends
on our commerce; for if our revenues fail from a diminution
of our commerce, additional imports will only add
to the evil. The enemy forms one great military empire.
The extent of country he covers does not render him so
dependent on an export and import trade. The whole
of that trade might perish and he could still continue the
war. If one third of ours were to fail we should be soon
reduced to peace.”</p>
</div>

<p>The proposed order, Bathurst argued, not only
restricted the neutral trade still further than had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
been done by Napoleon, but risked war with Russia
and America, without materially hurting France; he
added an argument which struck at the foundation
of Perceval’s policy:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The object of the proposed order, though general, is
in fact nothing but the colonial trade carried on through
America; and by making it general we unite Russia in
defence of a trade with which she has no concern or any
interest to defend. As far as America is concerned, it
must be expected she will resist it; and an American war
would be severely felt by our manufacturers, and even
by the very class of merchants now so eager for some
measure of relief. We might therefore have to fight for
a rule of war, new, the policy of which would be questionable,
to support an interest which would be the first
to suffer by the war,—against two countries, one of
which the order unnecessarily mixes in the question, and
with both of which we have great commercial relations.”</p>
</div>

<p>Bathurst closed by expressing a preference for the
Rule of 1756, or for a blockade of the West Indian
Islands,—which, if the Admiralty thought it practicable,
Bathurst considered as the best of all the
measures proposed; but besides this radical change,
he demanded certain alarming reforms. He complained
to Perceval that already, even under the
existing orders, such abuses prevailed that in order
to prevent a public parliamentary inquiry he had
been obliged by the general clamor of merchants to
investigate their grievances:<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The result of the examination established the truth
of the vexations to which the trade is now subject by
privateers, who are enabled to persevere in them in consequence
of the commercial restrictions and the proceedings
of the Court of Admiralty. In a communication I
had with Sir William Scott, who had been very angry
with the inquiry, I proposed some regulations which, indeed,
I knew would be unsatisfactory unless there were
some alterations in the proceedings of his Court,—a
subject which I did not venture to touch.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lord Bathurst’s well-meant efforts for reform, gentle
as they were, showed him the fortresses in which
corruption was already entrenched. Sir William
Scott, like his brother Lord Eldon, never relaxed his
grasp on a profitable abuse. He gave cogent reasons
for rejecting Lord Bathurst’s suggestions, and
could afford to disregard the danger of interference,
for Spencer Perceval was completely under the influence
of Lord Eldon. Bathurst urged Perceval to
reform the license-system, so that at least the license
should give complete protection to the cargo, no
matter to whom the cargo might belong; and he
hoped that this reform would put an end to the
abuses of the Admiralty Court. “But,” he added,
“I did not venture to give this as my reason before
Sir John Nichol [advocate-general], for you must be
aware that both his profits and those of Sir William
Scott depend much on privateers and the litigations
which, it is my hope, will by this alteration be considerably
diminished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Many members of the British government and
nearly the whole British navy were growing rich on the
plunder of American commerce. From King George
downward, mighty influences were involved in maintaining
a system which corrupted law officers, judges,
admirals, and even the King himself. Spencer Perceval’s
proposed Order in Council extended these
abuses over whatever branches of commerce had
hitherto been exempt; turned a new torrent of
corruption into the government; and polluted the
sources of British honor. In the light of Lord
Bathurst’s protest, and his significant avowal that
the object of the proposed order, though general
in form, was in fact nothing but the colonial trade
carried on through America, Canning might well
wish to <i>publish</i> nothing that would draw attention
to what he called the “commercial” side of the
affair. Jefferson’s measures of peaceful coercion
bore unexpected results, reacting upon foreign nations
by stimulating every mean and sordid motive.
No possible war could have so degraded
England.</p>

<p>As the Cabinet came closer to the point, the political,
or retaliatory, object of the new order disappeared,
and its commercial character was exclusively
set forth. In a letter written about November 30,
by Spencer Perceval to Charles Abbot, Speaker of the
House of Commons, not a word was said of retaliation,
or of any political motive in this process of “recasting
the law of trade and navigation, as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
belligerent principles are concerned, for the whole
world.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The short principle is,” said Perceval,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> “that trade
in British produce and manufactures, and trade either
from a British port or with a British destination, is to be
protected as much as possible. For this purpose all the
countries where French influence prevails to exclude the
British flag shall have no trade but to or from this
country, or from its allies. All other countries, the few
that remain strictly neutral (with the exception of the
colonial trade, which backward and forward direct they
may carry on), cannot trade but through this being done
as an ally with any of the countries connected with
France. If therefore we can accomplish our purpose,
it will come to this,—that either those countries will have
no trade, or they must be content to accept it through
us. This is a formidable and tremendous state of the
world; but all the part of it which is particularly harassing
to English interests was existing through the new
severity with which Bonaparte’s decrees of exclusion
against our trade were called into action. Our proceeding
does not aggravate our distress from it. If he can
keep out our trade he will; and he would do so if he
could, independent of our orders. Our orders only add
this circumstance: they say to the enemy, ‘If you will
not have <i>our</i> trade, as far as we can help it you shall
have <i>none</i>; and as to so much of any trade as you can
carry on yourselves, or others carry on with you through
us, if you admit it you shall pay for it. The only trade,
cheap and untaxed, which you shall have shall be either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
direct from us, in our own produce and manufactures,
or from our allies, whose increased prosperity will be an
advantage to us.’”</p>
</div>

<p>These private expressions implied that retaliation
upon France for her offence against international law
was a pretence on the part of Perceval and Canning,
under the cover of which they intended to force
British commerce upon France contrary to French
wishes. The act of Napoleon in excluding British
produce from French dominions violated no rule of
international law, and warranted no retaliation except
an exclusion of French produce from British
dominions. The rejoinder, “If you will not have <i>our</i>
trade you shall have <i>none</i>,” was not good law, if law
could be disputed when affirmed by men like Lord
Eldon and Lord Stowell, echoed by courts, parliaments,
and press,—not only in private, but in public;
not only in 1807, but for long years afterward; and
not only at moments, but without interruption.</p>

<p>Thus Canning, although he warned Perceval against
betraying the commercial object of his orders, instructed<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Erskine at Washington to point out that
American ships might still bring colonial produce
to England, under certain regulations, for re-export
to France. “The object of these regulations will be
the establishment of such a protecting duty as shall
prevent the enemy from obtaining the produce of his
own colonies at a cheaper rate than that of the
colonies of Great Britain.” Not to distress France,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
but to encourage British trade, was, according to
Canning, the object of this “political” weapon.</p>

<p>Thus Perceval, in the debate of Feb. 5, 1808, in
discussing the policy of his order, affirmed that the
British navy had been “rendered useless by neutral
ships carrying to France all that it was important
for France to obtain.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The Rule of 1756, he said,
would not have counteracted this result,—a much
stronger measure was necessary; and it was sound
policy “to endeavor to force a market.” Lord Bathurst,
a few days afterward, very frankly told<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the
House that “the object of these orders was to regulate
that which could not be prohibited,—the circuitous
trade through this country,”—in order that
the produce of enemies’ colonies might “be subjected
to a duty sufficiently high to prevent its having the
advantage over our own colonial produce;” and Lord
Hawkesbury, in the same debate, complained<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that
neutrals supplied colonial produce to France at a
much less rate than the English paid for it. “To
prevent this,” he said, “was the great object of the
Orders in Council.” James Stephen’s frequent arguments<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
in favor of the orders turned upon the
commercial value of the policy as against neutrals;
while George Rose, Vice-President of the Board of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Trade, went still further, and not only avowed, in
the face of Parliament, the hope that these Orders
in Council would make England the emporium of
all trade in the world, but even asserted, in an
unguarded moment of candor, that it was a mistake
to call the orders retaliatory,—they were a system of
self-defence, a plan to protect British commerce.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Thus, too, the orders themselves, while licensing
the export through England to France of all other
American produce, imposed a prohibitive duty on the
export of cotton, on the ground—as Canning officially
informed<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the American government—that
France had pushed her cotton manufactures to such
an extent as to make it expedient for England to
embarrass them.</p>

<p>According to the public and private avowals of all
the Ministry, the true object of Perceval’s orders
was, not to force a withdrawal of the Berlin Decree
so far as it violated international law, but to protect
British trade from competition. Perceval did not
wish to famish France, but to feed her. His object
was commercial, not political; his policy aimed at
checking the commerce of America in order to stimulate
the commerce of England. The pretence that
this measure had retaliation for its object and the
vindication of international law for its end was a
legal fiction, made to meet the objections of America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and to help Canning in maintaining a position which
he knew to be weak.</p>

<p>After this long discussion, and after conferences
not only with his colleagues in the Cabinet, but also
with George Rose, Vice-President of the Board of
Trade, with James Stephen, who was in truth the
author of the war on neutrals, and with a body of
merchants from the city,—at last, Nov. 11, 1807,
Spencer Perceval succeeded in getting his General
Order approved in Council. In its final shape this
famous document differed greatly from the original
draft. In deference to Lord Bathurst’s objections,
the sweeping doctrine of retaliation was omitted, so
that hardly an allusion to it was left in the text;
the assertion that neutrals had acquiesced in the
Berlin Decree was struck out; the preamble was
reduced, by Lord Eldon’s advice, to a mere mention
of the French pretended blockade, and of Napoleon’s
real prohibition of British commerce, followed by a
few short paragraphs reciting that Lord Howick’s
order of Jan. 7, 1807, had “not answered the desired
purpose either of compelling the enemy to recall
those orders or of inducing neutral nations to interpose
with effect to obtain their revocation, but on the
contrary the same have been recently enforced with
increased rigor;” and then, with the blunt assertion
that “his Majesty, under these circumstances, finds
himself compelled to take further measures for asserting
and vindicating his just rights,” Perceval, without
more apology, ordered in effect that all American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
commerce, except that to Sweden and the West
Indies, should pass through some British port and
take out a British license.</p>

<p>The exceptions, the qualifications, and the verbiage
of the British Orders need no notice. The ablest
British merchants gave up in despair the attempt
to understand them; and as one order followed
rapidly upon another, explaining, correcting, and
developing Perceval’s not too lucid style, the angry
Liberals declared their belief that he intended no
man to understand them without paying two guineas
for a legal opinion, with the benefit of a chance to
get a directly contrary opinion for the sum of two
guineas more.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Besides the express provisions contained
in the Order of November 11, it was understood
that American commerce with the enemies of
England must not only pass through British ports
with British license, but that colonial produce would
be made to pay a tax to the British Treasury to
enhance its price, while cotton would not be allowed
to enter France.</p>

<p>The general intention, however confused, was
simple. After November 11, 1807, any American
vessel carrying any cargo was liable to capture if
it sailed for any port in Europe from which the
British flag was excluded. In other words, American
commerce was made English.</p>

<p>This measure completed, diplomacy was to resume
its work. Even Canning’s audacity might be staggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to explain how the government of the United
States could evade war after it should fairly understand
the impressment Proclamation of October 17,
the Order in Council of November 11, and the Instructions
of George Henry Rose,—who was selected
by Canning as his special envoy for the adjustment of
the “Leopard’s” attack on the “Chesapeake,” and
who carried orders which made adjustment impossible.
Such outrages could be perpetrated only upon
a helpless people. Even in England, where Jefferson’s
pacific policy was well understood, few men believed
that peace could be longer preserved.</p>

<p>The curtain was about to rise upon a new tragedy,—the
martyrdom of Spain. At this dramatic spectacle
the United States government and people might
have looked with composure and without regret, for
they hardly felt so deep an interest in history,
literature, or art as to care greatly what was to
become of the land which had once produced Cortes,
Cervantes, and Murillo; but in the actual condition
of European politics their own interests were closely
entwined with those of Spain, and as the vast
designs of Napoleon were developed, the fortunes of
the Spanish empire more and more deeply affected
those of the American Union.</p>

<p>General Armstrong waited impatiently at Paris
while Napoleon carried on his desperate struggle with
the Emperor Alexander amid the ice and snows of
Prussia. After the battle of Eylau the American
minister became so restless that in May, 1807, he
demanded passports for Napoleon’s headquarters, but
was refused. Had he gone as he wished, he might
have seen the great battle of Friedland, June 14, and
witnessed the peace of Tilsit, signed July 7, which
swept away the last obstacle to Napoleon’s schemes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
against Spain and America. After the peace of
Tilsit, Armstrong could foresee that he should have
to wait but a short time for the explanations so
mysteriously delayed.</p>

<p>Except Denmark and Portugal, every State on the
coast of Europe from St. Petersburg to Trieste acknowledged
Napoleon’s domination. England held
out; and experience proved that England could not
be reached by arms. The next step in the Emperor’s
system was to effect her ruin by closing the whole
world to her trade. He began with Portugal. From
Dresden, July 19, he issued orders<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that the Portuguese
ports should be closed by September 1 against
English commerce, or the kingdom of Portugal would
be occupied by a combined French and Spanish army.
July 29 he was again in Paris. July 31 he ordered
Talleyrand to warn the Prince Royal of Denmark
that he must choose between war with England and
war with France. That the turn would next come
to the United States was evident; and Armstrong
was warned by many signs of the impending storm.
August 2, at the diplomatic audience, the brunt of
Napoleon’s displeasure fell on Dreyer, the Danish
minister, and on his colleague from Portugal; but
Armstrong could see that he was himself expected
to profit by the lesson. He wrote instantly to the
Secretary of State.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had yesterday our first audience of the Emperor
since his return to Paris. Happening to stand near the
minister of Denmark, I overheard his Majesty say to that
minister: ‘So, M. Baron, the Baltic has been violated!’
The minister’s answer was not audible to me; nor did it
appear to be satisfactory to the Emperor, who repeated,
in a tone of voice somewhat raised and peremptory, ‘But,
sir, the Baltic has been violated!’ From M. Dreyer he
passed to myself and others, and lastly to the ambassador
of Portugal, to whom, it is said, he read a very
severe lecture on the conduct of his Court. These circumstances
go far to justify the whispers that begin to
circulate, that an army is organizing to the south for the
purpose of taking possession of Portugal, and another to
the north for a similar purpose with regard to Denmark;
and generally, that, having settled the business of belligerents,
with the exception of England, very much to his
own liking, he is now on the point of settling that of
neutrals in the same way. It was perhaps under the
influence of this suggestion that M. Dreyer, taking me
aside, inquired whether any application had been made
to me with regard to a projected union of all commercial
States against Great Britain, and on my answering in the
negative, he replied: ‘You are much favored, but it will
not last!’”</p>
</div>

<p>A few days afterward another rumor ran through
Paris. The Prince of Benevento was no longer Minister
of Foreign Affairs, and his successor was to be
M. de Champagny, hitherto Minister of the Interior.
At first Armstrong would not believe in Talleyrand’s
disgrace. “It is not probable that this is
very serious, or that it will be very durable,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
wrote.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> “A trifling cause cannot alienate such a
master from such a minister; and a grave one could
not fail to break up all connections between them.”
Reasonable as this theory seemed, it was superficial.
The master and the minister had not only separated,
but had agreed to differ and to remain outwardly
friends. Their paths could no longer lie together; and
the overwhelming power of Bonaparte—who controlled
a million soldiers with no enemy to fight—made
cabals and Cabinet opposition not only useless
but ridiculous. Yet with all this, Talleyrand stood in
silent and cold disapproval of the Emperor’s course;
and since Talleyrand represented intelligent conservatism,
it was natural to suppose that the Emperor
meant to be even more violent in the future than in
the past. The new minister, Champagny, neither
suggested a policy of his own, nor presumed, as Talleyrand
sometimes dared, to argue or remonstrate
with his master.</p>

<p>Toward the end of August Dreyer’s prophecy became
true. Napoleon’s orders forced the King of
Denmark and King Louis of Holland to seize neutral
commerce and close the Danish and Dutch ports.
The question immediately rose whether United States
ships and property were still to be treated as exempt
from the operation of the Berlin Decree by virtue of
the treaty of 1800; and the Emperor promptly decided
against them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In actual circumstances,” he wrote to Decrès,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> “navigation
offers all sorts of difficulties. France cannot
regard as neutral flags which enjoy no consideration.
That of America, however exposed it may be to the insults
of the English, has a sort of existence, since the
English still keep some measure in regard to it, and it
imposes on them. That of Portugal and that of Denmark
exist no longer.”</p>
</div>

<p>This opinion was written before the British ministry
touched the Orders in Council; and the “sort of
existence” which Napoleon conceded to the United
States was already so vague as to be not easily
known from the extinction which had fallen upon
Portugal and Denmark. A few days afterward General
Armstrong received officially an order<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> from
the Emperor which expressly declared that the Berlin
Decree admitted of no exception in favor of American
vessels; and this step was followed by a letter<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> from
Champagny, dated October 7, to the same effect. At
the same time the Council of Prizes pronounced
judgment in the case of the American ship “Horizon,”
wrecked some six months before near Morlaix. The
Court decreed that such part of the cargo as was not
of English origin should be restored to its owners;
but that the merchandise which was acknowledged to
be of English manufacture or to come from English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
territory should be confiscated under the Berlin Decree.
To this decision Armstrong immediately responded
in a strong note<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> of protest to Champagny,
which called out an answer from the Emperor himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Reply to the American minister,” wrote Napoleon<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
to Champagny November 15, “that since America suffers
her vessels to be searched, she adopts the principle
that the flag does not cover the goods. Since she recognizes
the absurd blockades laid by England, consents to
having her vessels incessantly stopped, sent to England,
and so turned aside from their course, why should the
Americans not suffer the blockade laid by France? Certainly
France is no more blockaded by England than
England by France. Why should Americans not equally
suffer their vessels to be searched by French ships?
Certainly France recognizes that these measures are
unjust, illegal, and subversive of national sovereignty;
but it is the duty of nations to resort to force, and to
declare themselves against things which dishonor them
and disgrace their independence.”</p>
</div>

<p>Champagny wrote this message to Armstrong
November 24, taking the ground that America
must submit to the Berlin Decree because she submitted
to impressments and search.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>As a matter of relative wrong, Napoleon’s argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
was more respectable than that of Spencer Perceval
and George Canning. He could say with truth
that the injury he did to America was wholly consequential
on the injury he meant to inflict on England.
He had no hidden plan of suppressing American
commerce in order to develop the commerce of
France; as yet he was not trying to make money
by theft. His Berlin Decree interfered in no way
with the introduction of American products directly
into France; it merely forbade the introduction of
English produce or the reception of ships which came
from England. Outrageous as its provisions were,
“unjust, illegal, and subversive of national sovereignty,”
as Napoleon himself admitted and avowed,
they bore their character and purpose upon their
face, and in that sense were legitimate. He had no
secrets on this point. In a famous diplomatic audience
at Fontainebleau October 14, Armstrong witnessed
a melodramatic scene, in which the Emperor
proclaimed to the world that his will was to be law.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
“The House of Braganza shall reign no more,” said
he to the Portuguese minister; then turning to the
representative of the Queen of Etruria,—the same
Spanish princess on whose head he had five years before
placed the shadowy crown of Tuscany,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your mistress,” he said, “has her secret attachments
to Great Britain,—as you, Messieurs Deputies of the
Hanse Towns are also said to have; but I will put an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
end to this. Great Britain shall be destroyed. I have
the means of doing it, and they shall be employed. I
have three hundred thousand men devoted to this object,
and an ally who has three hundred thousand to
support them. I will permit no nation to receive a minister
from Great Britain until she shall have renounced
her maritime usages and tyranny; and I desire you,
gentlemen, to convey this determination to your respective
sovereigns.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong obeyed the order; and in doing so he
might easily have pointed out the machinery by which
Napoleon expected to insure the co-operation of
America in securing the destruction of England. He
could combine the Berlin Decree with the baffled
negotiations for Florida, and could understand why
the Emperor at one moment dangled the tempting
bait before Jefferson’s eyes, and the next snatched
it away. This diplomatic game was one which Napoleon
played with every victim he wished to ensnare,
and the victim never showed enough force of character
to resist temptation. German, Italian, Russian,
Spaniard, American, had all been lured by this
decoy; one after another had been caught and
devoured, but the next victim never saw the trap,
or profited by the cries of the last unfortunate.
Armstrong knew that whenever Napoleon felt the
United States slipping through his fingers, Florida
would again be offered to keep Jefferson quiet; yet
even Armstrong, man of the world as he was, tried
to persuade himself that Napoleon did not know his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
own mind. One of his despatches at this crisis
related a curious story, which he evidently believed
to be true, and to prove the vacillating temper of
Napoleon’s Florida negotiation.</p>

<p>November 15 Armstrong wrote that the Emperor
had left Fontainebleau for Italy; that great changes
were predicted, among which it was rumored “that
Portugal, taken from the Braganzas, may be lent to
the children of the Toscan House, and that the Bourbons
of Spain are at last to make way for Lucien
Bonaparte, who, in atonement or from policy, is to
marry the Queen Regent of Etruria.” That the
American minister should at that early day have
been so well informed about projects as yet carefully
concealed, was creditable to his diplomacy. Not till
nearly a month later did Lucien himself, in his Italian
banishment, receive notice of the splendid bribe intended
for him.</p>

<p>In the same despatch of November 15 Armstrong
discussed the Emperor’s plans in their bearing on
Florida. “We are, it seems, to be invited to make
common cause against England, and to take the guaranty
of the Continent for a maritime peace which
shall establish the principle of ‘free ships, free goods.’”
Armstrong argued that it was wiser to act alone,
even in case of war with England; in regard to
Florida, France had done all that was to be expected
from her, and had latterly become sparing even of
promises. Finally, he told the anecdote already
alluded to:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact appears to be, which I communicate with
the most intimate conviction of its truth, that some sycophant,
entering into the weakness of the Emperor, and
perceiving that he was only happy in giving a little more
circumference to the bubble, seized the moment of Izquierdo’s
nomination, and pointing to the United States,
said: ‘These are destined to form the last labor of the
modern Hercules. The triumph over England cannot be
complete so long as the commerce and republicanism of
this country be permitted to exist. Will it then be wise
to insulate it,—to divest yourselves or your allies of
those points which would place you at once in the midst
of it? With what view was it that after selling Louisiana,
attempts were made by France to buy the Floridas
from Spain? Was it not in the anticipation of events
which may make necessary to you a place in the neighborhood
of these States,—a point on which to rest your
political lever? Remember that Archimedes could not
move the world without previously finding a resting-place
for his screw. Instead, therefore, of parting with the
Floridas, I would suggest whether we should not make
the repossession of Canada a condition of a peace with
England.’ The conception itself, and the manner in
which it was presented, struck the Emperor forcibly.
He mused a moment upon it, and then in the most peremptory
manner ordered that the negotiation should
not go on.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong regarded this anecdote as important.
Perhaps he had it, directly or indirectly, from Talleyrand,
who used more freedom of speech than was
permitted to any other man in France; but the task
of penetrating the depths of Napoleon’s mind was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
one which even Talleyrand attempted in vain. From
the first, Florida had been used by Napoleon as a
means of controlling President Jefferson. “To enlarge
the circumference of his bubble” was a phrase
keen and terse enough to have come from Talleyrand
himself; but this was not the purpose for which
Florida had hitherto been used in Napoleon’s diplomacy,
and in ordering that the negotiation should be
stopped, the Emperor might well have other motives,
which he preferred keeping to himself.</p>

<p>An observer far less intelligent than Armstrong
might have seen that in face of the great changes
which his despatch announced for Italy, Portugal,
and Spain, the time when Napoleon would need support
from the United States had not yet come. The
critical moment was still in the future. Perhaps
America might be forced into war by the “Chesapeake”
outrage; at all events, she was further than
ever from alliance with England, and the Emperor
could safely wait for her adhesion to the continental
system until his plans for consolidating his empire
were more mature. For the present, Don Carlos IV.
and the Prince of Peace were the chief objects of
French diplomacy.</p>

<p>The story of Toussaint and St. Domingo was about
to be repeated in Spain. Even while Armstrong wrote
these despatches, the throne of Don Carlos IV. crumbled,
almost without need of a touch from without.
France had drawn from Spain everything she once
possessed,—her navy, sacrificed at Trafalgar to Napoleon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
orders; her army, nearly half of which was
in Denmark; her treasures, which, so far as they
had not been paid in subsidies to Napoleon, were shut
up in Mexico. Nothing but the shell was left of all
that had made Spain great. This long depletion had
not been effected without extreme anxiety on the part
of the Spanish government. At any time after the
Prince of Peace returned to power in 1801, he would
gladly have broken with France, as he proved in
1806; but he stood in much the same position as
Jefferson, between the selfishness of England and
the immediate interests of Spain. King Charles,
anxious beyond measure for his own repose and for
the safety of his daughter the Queen of Etruria,
shrank from every strong measure of resistance to
Napoleon’s will, yet was so helpless that only a traitor
or a coward could have deserted him; and Godoy,
with all his faults, was not so base as to secure his
own interests by leaving the King to Napoleon’s
mercy. For a single moment the King yielded to
Godoy’s entreaties. When the fourth European coalition
was formed against Napoleon, and Prussia declared
war, the Prince of Peace was allowed to issue,
Oct. 6, 1806, a proclamation calling the Spanish people
to arms. October 14 the battle of Jena was
fought, and the news reaching Madrid threw the
King and court into consternation; Godoy’s influence
was broken by the shock; the proclamation was
recalled, and the old King bowed his head to his fate.
Had he held firm, and thrown in his fortunes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
those of England, Russia, and Prussia, the battle of
Eylau might have stopped Napoleon’s career; and in
any case the fate of Spain could not have been more
terrible than it was.</p>

<p>The Prince of Peace begged in vain that King
Charles would dismiss him and form a new ministry;
the King could not endure a change. Napoleon
laughed at the proclamation, but he knew Godoy to
be his only serious enemy at Madrid. He took infinite
pains, and exhausted the extraordinary resources
of his cunning, in order to get possession of Spain
without a blow. To do this, he forced Portugal into
what he called a war. Without noticing Godoy’s
offence, immediately after the peace of Tilsit, as has
been already told, the Emperor ordered the King of
Portugal to execute the Berlin Decree. Unable to
resist, Portugal consented to shut her ports to English
commerce, but objected to confiscating British
property. Without a moment’s delay, Napoleon,
October 12,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> ordered General Junot, with an army of
twenty thousand men, to enter Spain within twenty-four
hours, and march direct to Lisbon; simultaneously
he notified<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the Spanish government that his
troops would be at Burgos, November 1; and that
this time “it was not intended to do as was done in
the last war,—he must march straight to Lisbon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>After the peace of Tilsit, no Power in Europe pretended
to question Napoleon’s will, and for Spain to
do so would have been absurd. King Charles had
to submit, and he sent an army to co-operate with
Junot against Portugal. The Emperor, who might
at a single word have driven King Charles as well
as the King of Portugal from the throne, did not say
the word. Godoy’s proclamation had given France
cause for war; but Napoleon took no notice of the
proclamation. He did not ask for the punishment of
Godoy; he not only left the old King in peace, but
took extraordinary care to soothe his fears. On the
same day when he ordered Junot to march, he wrote
personally to reassure the King:<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> “I will concert with
your Majesty as to what shall be done with Portugal;
in any case the suzerainty shall belong to you, as
you have seemed to wish.” Yet four days later he
ordered<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> another army of thirty thousand men to
be collected at Bayonne, to support Junot, who had
no enemy to fear. That his true campaign was
against Spain, not against Portugal, never admitted
of a doubt; his orders to Junot hardly concealed
his object:<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cause descriptions to be made for me of all the
provinces through which you pass,—the roads, the nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
of the ground; send me sketches. Charge engineer
officers with this work, which it is important to have; so
that I can see the distance of the villages, the nature
of the country, the resources it offers.... I learn this
moment that Portugal has declared war on England
and sent away the English ambassador: this does not
satisfy me; continue your march; I have reason to believe
that it is agreed upon with England in order to
give time for the English troops to come from Copenhagen.
You must be at Lisbon by December 1, as
friend or as enemy. Maintain the utmost harmony
with the Prince of Peace.”</p>
</div>

<p>Junot entered Spain October 17, the same day that
these orders were written, while Napoleon at Fontainebleau
forced on the Spanish agent Izquierdo a
treaty which might keep King Charles and Godoy
quiet a little longer. This document, drafted by Napoleon
himself, resembled the letter to Toussaint
and the proclamation to the negroes of St. Domingo,
with which Leclerc had been charged;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> its motive
was too obvious, and its appeal to selfishness too
gross to deceive. It declared<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that Portugal should
be divided into three parts. The most northerly,
with Oporto for a capital and a population of eight
hundred thousand souls, should be given to the Queen
of Etruria in place of Tuscany, which was to be
swallowed up in the kingdom of Italy. The next
provision was even more curious. The southern part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of Portugal, with a population of four hundred thousand
souls, should be given to the Prince of Peace as
an independent sovereignty. The central part, with
a population of two millions, and Lisbon for a capital,
should be held by France subject to further agreement.
By a final touch of dissimulation worthy of
Shakespeare’s tragic invention, Napoleon, in the last
article of this treaty, promised to recognize Don
Carlos IV. as Emperor of the two Americas.</p>

<p>The so-called treaty of Fontainebleau was signed
Oct. 27, 1807. That it deceived Godoy or King
Charles could hardly be imagined, but the internal
and external difficulties of Spain had reached a point
where nothing but ruin remained. In the whole of
Spain hardly twenty thousand troops could be assembled;
barely half-a-dozen frigates were fit for sea;
the treasury was empty; industry was destroyed.
Napoleon himself had no idea how complete was the
process by which he had sucked the life-blood of
this miserable land. Even in the court at Madrid and
among the people signs of an immediate catastrophe
were so evident that Napoleon could afford to wait
until chaos should call for his control.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Junot marched steadily forward. He
was at Burgos on the day fixed by Napoleon; he
established permanent French depots at Valladolid
and at Salamanca. Leaving Salamanca November
12, he advanced to Ciudad Rodrigo, and after establishing
another depot there, he made a rapid dash
at Lisbon. The march was difficult, but Junot was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
ready to destroy his army rather than fail to carry
out his orders; and on the morning of November 30
he led a ragged remnant of fifteen hundred men into
the city of Lisbon. He found it without a government.
The Prince Regent of Portugal, powerless to
resist Napoleon, had gone on board his ships with the
whole royal family and court, and was already on his
way to found a new empire at Rio Janeiro. Of all
the royal houses of Europe, that of Portugal was the
first to carry out a desperate resolution.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s object was thus gained. Dec. 1, 1807,
Junot was in peaceable possession of Lisbon, and
French garrisons held every strategical point between
Lisbon and Bayonne. In regard to Portugal
Junot’s orders were precise:<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So soon as you have the different fortified places in
your hands, you will put French commandants in them,
and will make yourself sure of these places. I need not
tell you that you must not put any fortress in the power
of the Spaniards, especially in the region which is to
remain in my hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>November 3, without the knowledge of Spain, the
Emperor gave orders<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that the army of reserve at
Bayonne, under General Dupont, shall be ready to
march by December 1; and November 11 he ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span><a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
that the frontier fortresses on the Spanish border
should be armed and supplied with provisions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“All this is to be done with the utmost possible secrecy,
especially the armament of the places on the Spanish
frontier on the side of the eastern Pyrenees. Give
secret instructions, and let the corps march in such a
manner that the first ostensible operations be not seen in
that country before November 25.”</p>
</div>

<p>At the same time a new army of some twenty
thousand men was hurried across France to take the
place, at Bayonne, of Dupont’s army, which was to
enter Spain. November 13, the Emperor ordered
Dupont to move his first division across the frontier
to Vittoria; and on the same day he despatched M.
de Tournon, his chamberlain, with a letter to King
Charles at Madrid, and with secret instructions<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> that
revealed the reasons for these movements so carefully
concealed from Spanish eyes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will also inform yourself, without seeming to do
so, of the situation of the places of Pampeluna and of
Fontarabia; and if you perceive armaments making anywhere,
you will inform me by courier. You will be on
the watch at Madrid to see well the spirit which animates
that city.”</p>
</div>

<p>Napoleon’s orders were in all respects exactly carried
out. Dec. 1, 1807, Junot was in possession of
Portugal; Dupont was at Vittoria; twenty-five thousand
French troops would, by December 20, hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
the great route from Vittoria to Burgos, and in two
days could occupy Madrid.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The Spanish army was
partly in Denmark, partly in Portugal. The Prince
of Peace heard what was going on, and asked for
explanations; but the moment for resistance had
long passed. He had no choice but submission or
flight, and Don Carlos was too weak to fly.</p>

<p>In Armstrong’s despatch of November 15, already
quoted, one more paragraph was worth noting. At
the moment he wrote, Napoleon had just given his
last orders; General Dupont had not yet received
them, and neither Don Carlos IV. nor Lucien Bonaparte
knew the change of plan that was intended.
Only men like Talleyrand and Duroc could see that
from the moment of the peace at Tilsit, Napoleon’s
movements had been rapidly and irresistibly converging
upon Madrid,—until, by the middle of November,
every order had been given, and the Spanish
Peninsula lay, as the Emperor told Lucien, “in the
hollow of his hand.” Armstrong, writing a fortnight
before the royal family of Portugal had turned their
vessels’ prows toward Brazil, asked a question which
Napoleon himself would hardly have dared to answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What will become of the royal houses of Portugal
and Spain? I know not. By the way, I consider this
question as of no small interest to the United States. If
they were sent to America, or are even permitted to withdraw
thither, we may conclude that the colonies which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
excite the imperial longing, and which are in its opinion
necessary to France, are not on our side of the Atlantic.
If on the other hand they are retained in Europe, it will
only be as hostages for the eventual delivery of their
colonies; and then, at the distance of three centuries,
may be acted over again the tragedy of the Incas, with
some few alterations of scenery and names.”</p>
</div>

<p>All these measures being completed by November
15, the day when Armstrong wrote his despatch, the
Emperor left Fontainebleau and went to Italy. He
passed through Milan and Verona to Venice; and on
his return, stopped a few hours at Mantua,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> on the
night of December 13, to offer Lucien the throne
of Spain.</p>

<p>Lucien’s story<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> was that being summoned from
Rome to an interview, he found his brother alone, at
midnight of December 13, seated in a vast room in
the palace at Mantua, before a great round table,
almost entirely covered by a very large map of Spain,
on which he was marking strategical points with
black, red, and yellow pins. After a long interview,
in which the Emperor made many concessions to his
brother’s resistance, Napoleon opened his last and
most audacious offer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘As for you, choose!’ As he pronounced these
words,” continued Lucien, “his eyes sparkled with a
flash of pride which seemed to me Satanic; he struck
a great blow with his hand, spread out broadly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
middle of the immense map of Europe which was extended
on the table by the side of which we were standing.
‘Yes, choose!’ he said; ‘you see I am not talking
in the air. All this is mine, or will soon belong to me;
I can dispose of it already. Do you want Naples? I will
take it from Joseph, who, by the bye, does not care for
it; he prefers Morfontaine. Italy,—the most beautiful
jewel in my imperial crown? Eugene is but viceroy,
and far from despising it he hopes only that I shall give
it to him, or at least leave it to him if he survives me:
he is likely to be disappointed in waiting, for I shall live
ninety years; I must, for the perfect consolidation of
my empire. Besides, Eugene will not suit me in Italy
after his mother is repudiated. Spain? Do you not
see it falling into the hollow of my hand, thanks to the
blunders of your dear Bourbons, and to the follies of
your friend the Prince of Peace? Would you not be
well pleased to reign there where you have been only
ambassador? Once for all, what do you want? Speak!
Whatever you wish, or can wish, is yours, if your
divorce precedes mine.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Lucien refused a kingdom on such terms, and
Napoleon continued his journey, reaching Milan December
15. At that time his mind was intent on
Spain and the Spanish colonies, with which the questions
of English and American trade were closely
connected. Spencer Perceval’s Orders in Council had
appeared in the “London Gazette” of November 14,
and had followed the Emperor to Italy. Some weeks
afterward war was declared between England and
Russia. No neutral remained except Sweden, which
was to be crushed by Russia, and the United States of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
America, which Napoleon meant to take in hand. December
17, from the royal palace at Milan, in retaliation
for the Orders in Council, and without waiting to
consult President Jefferson, Napoleon issued a new
proclamation, compared with which the Berlin Decree
of the year before was a model of legality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Considering,” began the preamble,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> “that by these
acts the English government has denationalized the ships
of all the nations of Europe; that it is in the power of
no government to compound its own independence and
its rights,—all the sovereigns in Europe being jointly
interested in the sovereignty and independence of their
flag; that if by an inexcusable weakness, which would
be an ineffaceable stain in the eyes of posterity, we
should allow such a tyranny to pass into a principle
and to become consecrated by usage, the English would
take advantage of it to establish it as a right, as they
have profited by the tolerance of governments to establish
the infamous principle that the flag does not cover
the goods, and to give to their right of blockade an
arbitrary extension, contrary to the sovereignty of all
States,”—</p>
</div>

<p>Considering all these matters, so important to States
like Denmark, Portugal, and Spain, whose flags had
ceased to exist, and of whose honor and interests this
mighty conqueror made himself champion, Napoleon
decreed that every ship which should have been
searched by an English vessel, or should have paid
any duty to the British government, or should come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
from or be destined for any port in British possession
in any part of the world, should be good prize;
and that this rule should continue in force until
England should have “returned to the principles of
international law, which are also those of justice and
honor.”</p>

</div>


<p>Oct. 29, 1807, Monroe left London; and November
14, the day when the Orders in Council were first
published in the official “Gazette,” he sailed from
Plymouth for home.</p>

<p>Nearly five years had passed since Monroe received
the summons from Jefferson which drew him
from his retirement in Virginia to stand forward
as the diplomatic champion of the United States in
contest with the diplomatists of Europe; and these
five years had been full of unpleasant experience.
Since signing the Louisiana treaty, in May, 1803, he
had met only with defeat and disaster. Insulted by
every successive Foreign Secretary in France, Spain,
and England; driven from Madrid to Paris and from
Paris to London; set impossible tasks, often contrary
to his own judgment,—he had ended by yielding to
the policy of the British government, and by meeting
with disapproval and disavowal from his own. As
he looked back on the receding shores of England,
he could hardly fail to recall the circumstances of his
return from France ten years before. In many respects
Monroe’s career was unparalleled, but he was
singular above all in the experience of being disowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
by two Presidents as strongly opposed to each
other as Washington and Jefferson, and of being sacrificed
by two secretaries as widely different as Timothy
Pickering and James Madison.</p>

<p>In America only two men of much note were prepared
to uphold his course, and of these the President
was not one; yet Jefferson exerted himself to
disguise and soften Monroe’s discredit. He kept the
treaty a secret when its publication would have destroyed
Monroe’s popularity and strengthened Madison.
When at length, after eight months’ delay, the
British note appended to the treaty was revealed,
Monroe’s friend Macon, though anxious to make him
President, privately admitted that “the extract of
the treaty which has been published has injured Monroe
more than the return of it by the President.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
John Randolph alone held up Monroe and his treaty
as models of statesmanship; and although Randolph
was the only Republican who cared to go this length,
Monroe found one other friend and apologist in a
person who rivalled Randolph in his usual economy
of praise. Timothy Pickering held that Merry and
Erskine were no good Englishmen, but he was satisfied
with Monroe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sincerely wish an English minister here to be a
very able man,” he wrote<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> privately from Washington to
a friend in Philadelphia,—“one who will feel and justly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
estimate the dignity of his country, and bring down the
supercilious looks of our strutting Administration. The
feebleness of Merry and Erskine have encouraged them
to assume a vain importance and haughtiness as remote
from the genuine spirit and as injurious to the solid interests
of our country as they are irritating to Great Britain.
The ridiculous gasconade of our rulers has indeed disgraced
our nation. The sentiment above expressed is excited
by the consideration that Great Britain is our only
shield against the overwhelming power of Bonaparte;
and therefore I view the maintenance of her just rights
as essential to the preservation of our own. I have
regretted to see our newspapers continue to reproach
Monroe. His abilities you know how to estimate, but
I never considered him as wanting in probity. An
<i>enragé</i> relative to the French, and implicitly relying on
the advice of Jefferson, his deportment did not permit
his remaining the minister of the United States at Paris
[in 1797]; but I have certain information that at London
no one could conduct with more propriety than he does;
and, such is his sense of the proceedings of our rulers, he
lately said he did not know how long the British government
would bear with our petulance.”</p>
</div>

<p>This letter, written while Monroe was at sea,
betrayed a hope that the notorious quarrel between
him and Jefferson would prove to be permanent; but
Pickering could never learn to appreciate Jefferson’s
genius for peace. Doubtless only personal friendship
and the fear of strengthening Federalist influence prevented
President Jefferson from denouncing Monroe’s
conduct as forcibly as President Washington had denounced
it ten years before; and Jefferson’s grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of complaint were more serious than Washington’s.
Monroe expected and even courted martyrdom, and
never quite forgot the treatment he received. In private,
George Hay, Monroe’s son-in-law, who knew all
the secrets of his career, spoke afterward of Jefferson
as “one of the most insincere men in the world; ...
his enmity to Mr. Monroe was inveterate, though disguised,
and he was at the bottom of all the opposition
to Mr. Monroe in Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Peacemakers must
submit to the charges which their virtues entail, but
Jefferson’s silence and conciliation deserved a better
return than to be called insincere.</p>

<p>Monroe returned to Virginia, praised by George
Canning and Timothy Pickering, to be John Randolph’s
candidate for the Presidency, while Jefferson
could regard him in no other light than as a dupe of
England, and Madison was obliged to think him a
personal enemy. As a result of five years’ honest,
patient, and painstaking labor, this division from old
friends was sad enough; but had Monroe been a nervous
man, so organized as to feel the arrows of his
outrageous fortune, his bitterest annoyance on bidding
final farewell to Europe would have been, not the
thought of his reception in America, not even the
memory of Talleyrand’s reproofs, or of the laurels
won by Don Pedro Cevallos, or of Lord Harrowby’s
roughness, or Lord Mulgrave’s indifference, or Lord
Howick’s friendly larcenies, or Canning’s smooth impertinences,—as
a diplomatist he would rather have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
felt most hurt that the British ministry had contrived
a new measure of vital interest to America, and
should have allowed him to depart without a word
of confidence, explanation, or enlightenment as to the
nature of the fresh aggression which was to close a
long list of disasters with one which left to America
only the title of an independent nation.</p>

<p>As early as October 3 the “Morning Post” announced
at great length that his Majesty’s government
had adopted the principle of retaliation. November
10, while Monroe was still waiting at Portsmouth for
a fair wind, the “Times” made known that a proclamation
was in readiness for the King’s signature, declaring
France and all her vassal kingdoms in a state
of siege: “The sum of all reasoning on the subject is
included in this, that the Continent must and will
have colonial productions in spite of the orders and
decrees of its master, and we are to take care that
she have no other colonial produce than our own.”
The fact that American commerce with the Continent
was to be forbidden became a matter of public notoriety
in London before November 13, and on Saturday,
November 14, the day when Monroe’s ship sailed
from Portsmouth, the order appeared in the “Gazette;”
yet Monroe himself would be obliged to appear
before the President in official ignorance of a
measure discussed and adopted under his eyes.</p>

<p>George Henry Rose, whom Canning selected as
special envoy to settle the “Chesapeake” affair, and
who sailed in the “Statira” frigate two days before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Monroe, knew officially as little as Monroe himself of
the coming order; but this ignorance was due to
Canning’s settled plan of keeping the “Chesapeake”
affair independent of every other dispute. Canning
could have had no deep motive in withholding official
knowledge of the order from Monroe, Pinkney, and
Rose; he could not have foreseen when or how the
winds would blow; yet, by mere accident, one day’s
delay added greatly to the coming embarrassments
of the American government. The departure of
vessels depended on a favorable wind, and for some
weeks before November 14 westerly winds prevailed.
About that day the weather changed, and all the
ships bound to America sailed nearly together. The
“Statira” and “Augustus,” carrying Rose and Monroe,
started from Portsmouth for Norfolk; the “Revenge”
set sail from Cherbourg, with despatches from
Armstrong; the “Brutus,” with London newspapers
of November 12, departed from Liverpool for New
York; and the “Edward,” with London newspapers
and letters to November 10, left Liverpool for Boston.
All were clear of land by November 14, when
the “Gazette” published the Order in Council; but
for weeks afterward no other vessels crossed the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>After the “Revenge” sailed for Europe in July, on
her errand of redress for the “Chesapeake” outrage,
the Americans waited more and more patiently for
her return. The excitement which blazed in midsummer
from one end of the country to the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
began to subside when men learned that Admiral
Berkeley’s orders had been issued without the authority
or knowledge of his government, and would probably
be disavowed. The news that came from Europe
tended to chill the fever for war. The Peace of
Tilsit, the Tory reaction in England, the bombardment
of Copenhagen, the execution of the Berlin
Decree in Holland, the threatened retaliation by
Great Britain were events calculated to raise more
than a doubt of the benefits which war could bring.
In any case, the risks of commerce had become too
great for legitimate trade; and every one felt that
the further pursuit of neutral profits could end only
in bringing America into the arms of one or the
other of the Powers which were avowedly disputing
pre-eminence in wrong.</p>

<p>The attack on the “Chesapeake,” the trial of Aaron
Burr, and the news from Copenhagen, Holland, and
London made the summer and autumn of 1807 anxious
and restless; but another event, under the eyes
of the American people, made up a thousand fold,
had they but known it, for all the losses or risks
incurred through Burr, Bonaparte, or Canning. That
the destinies of America must be decided in America
was a maxim of true Democrats, but one which they
showed little energy in reducing to practice. A few
whose names could be mentioned in one or two
lines,—men like Chancellor Livingston, Dr. Mitchill,
Joel Barlow,—hailed the 17th of August, 1807, as
the beginning of a new era in America,—a date<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
which separated the colonial from the independent
stage of growth; for on that day, at one o’clock in
the afternoon, the steamboat “Clermont,” with Robert
Fulton in command, started on her first voyage.
A crowd of bystanders, partly sceptical, partly hostile,
stood about and watched the clumsy craft slowly
forge its way at the rate of four miles an hour up
the river; but Fulton’s success left room for little
doubt or dispute, except in minds impervious to proof.
The problem of steam navigation, so far as it applied
to rivers and harbors was settled, and for the first
time America could consider herself mistress of her
vast resources. Compared with such a step in her
progress, the mediæval barbarisms of Napoleon and
Spencer Perceval signified little more to her than
the doings of Achilles and Agamemnon. Few moments
in her history were more dramatic than the
weeks of 1807 which saw the shattered “Chesapeake”
creep back to her anchorage at Hampton Roads, and
the “Clermont” push laboriously up the waters of
the Hudson; but the intellectual effort of bringing
these two events together, and of settling the political
and economical problems of America at once, passed
the genius of the people. Government took no notice
of Fulton’s achievement, and the public for some
years continued, as a rule, to travel in sailing packets
and on flat-boats. The reign of politics showed
no sign of ending. Fulton’s steamer went its way,
waiting until men’s time should become so valuable
as to be worth saving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>The unfailing mark of a primitive society was to
regard war as the most natural pursuit of man; and
history with reason began as a record of war, because,
in fact, all other human occupations were secondary
to this. The chief sign that Americans had other
qualities than the races from which they sprang, was
shown by their dislike for war as a profession, and
their obstinate attempts to invent other methods for
obtaining their ends; but in the actual state of mankind,
safety and civilization could still be secured only
through the power of self-defence. Desperate physical
courage was the common quality on which all
great races had founded their greatness; and the
people of the United States, in discarding military
qualities, without devoting themselves to science,
were trying an experiment which could succeed only
in a world of their own.</p>

<p>In charging America with having lost her national
character, Napoleon said no more than the truth. As
a force in the affairs of Europe, the United States
had become an appendage to England. The Americans
consumed little but English manufactures, allowed
British ships to blockade New York and
Chesapeake Bay, permitted the British government
to keep by force in its naval service numbers of persons
who were claimed as American subjects, and to
take from American merchant-vessels, at its free
will, any man who seemed likely to be useful; they
suffered their commerce with France and Spain to be
plundered by Great Britain without resistance, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
be regulated in defiance of American rights. Nothing
could exceed England’s disregard of American
dignity. When the “Bellona” and her consorts
were ordered to depart from Chesapeake Bay, her
captain not only disregarded the order, but threatened
to take by force whatever he wanted on shore,
and laughed at the idea of compulsion. On land still
less respect was shown to American jurisdiction.
When after the “Chesapeake” outrage the people
talked of war, the first act of Sir James Craig, governor-general
of Canada, was to send messages<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to
the Indian tribes in the Indiana Territory, calling for
their assistance in case of hostilities; and the effect
of this appeal was instantly felt at Vincennes and
Greenville, where it gave to the intrigues of the
Shawanese prophet an impulse that alarmed every
settler on the frontier. Every subordinate officer of
the British government thought himself at liberty to
trample on American rights; and while the English
navy controlled the coast, and the English army from
Canada gave orders to the northwestern Indians, the
British minister at Washington encouraged and concealed
the conspiracy of Burr.</p>

<p>The evil had reached a point where some corrective
must be found; but four years of submission had
broken the national spirit. In 1805 the people were
almost ready for war with England on the question of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the indirect, or carrying, trade of the French and
Spanish West Indies. After submitting on that point,
in July, 1807, they were again ready to fight for the
immunity of their frigates from impressment; but by
the close of the year their courage had once more
fallen, and they hoped to escape the necessity of fighting
under any circumstances whatever, anxiously
looking for some expedient, or compromise, which
would reconcile a policy of resistance with a policy of
peace. This expedient Jefferson and Madison had
for fifteen years been ready to offer them.</p>

<p>So confident was Jefferson in his theory of peaceable
coercion that he would hardly have thought his
administrative career complete, had he quitted office
without being allowed to prove the value of his
plan. The fascination which it exercised over his
mind was quite as much due to temperament as
to logic; for if reason told him that Europe could
be starved into concession, temperament added another
motive still more alluring. If Europe persisted
in her conduct America would still be safe, and all
the happier for cutting off connection with countries
where violence and profligacy ruled supreme. The
idea of ceasing intercourse with obnoxious nations reflected
his own personality in the mirror of statesmanship.
In the course of the following year he
wrote to a young grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph,
a letter<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of parental advice in regard to the
conduct of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Be a listener only,” he said; “keep within yourself,
and endeavor to establish with yourself the habit of
silence, especially on politics. In the fevered state of
our country no good can ever result from any attempt to
set one of these fiery zealots to rights, either in fact or
principle. They are determined as to the facts they
will believe, and the opinions on which they will act.
Get by them, therefore, as you would by an angry bull;
it is not for a man of sense to dispute the road with such
an animal.”</p>
</div>

<p>The advice was good, and did honor to the gentleness
of Jefferson’s nature; but a course of conduct
excellent in social life could not be made to suit the
arena of politics. As President of the United States,
Jefferson was bent upon carrying out the plan of
keeping within himself; but the bull of which he
spoke as unfit for a man of sense to dispute with, and
which he saw filling the whole path before him, was
not only angry, but mad with pain and blind with
rage; his throat and flanks were torn and raw where
the Corsican wolf had set his teeth; a pack of mastiffs
and curs were baiting him and yelling at his
heels, and his blood-shot eyes no longer knew friend
from foe, as he rushed with a roar of stupid rage
directly upon the President. To get by him was
impossible. To fly was the only resource, if the
President would not stand his ground and stop the
animal by skill or force.</p>

<p>Few rulers ever succeeded in running from danger
with dignity. Even the absolute Emperor of Russia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
had not wholly preserved the respect of his subjects
after the sudden somersault performed at Tilsit; and
the Prince Regent of Portugal had been forced to
desert his people when he banished himself to Brazil.
President Jefferson had not their excuse for flight;
but resistance by force was already impossible. For
more than six years he had conducted government on
the theory of peaceable coercion, and his own friends
required that the experiment should be tried. He
was more than willing, he was anxious, to gratify
them; and he believed himself to have solved the
difficult problem of stopping his enemy, while running
away from him without loss of dignity and without
the appearance of flight.</p>

<p>General Turreau, after hoping for a time that the
government would accept the necessity of war with
England, became more and more bitter as he watched
the decline of the war spirit; and September 4, barely
two months after the assault on the “Chesapeake,”
and long before the disavowal of Berkeley was
known, he wrote to Talleyrand a diatribe against the
Americans:<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the sentiments of fear and of servile deference for
England with which the inhabitants of the American
Union are penetrated, were not as well known as their
indifference for everything which bears the name of
French, what has passed since the attack on the frigate
‘Chesapeake’ would prove to the most vulgar observer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
not only that the Anglo-Americans have remained in
reality dependent on Great Britain, but even that this
state of subjection conforms with their affections as well
as with their habits. He will also be convinced that
France has, and will ever have, nothing to hope from the
dispositions of a people that conceives no idea of glory,
of grandeur, of justice; that shows itself the constant
enemy of liberal principles; and that is disposed to
suffer every kind of humiliation, provided it can satisfy
both its sordid avarice and its projects of usurpation
over the Floridas.”</p>
</div>

<p>Scandalized at the rapid evaporation of American
courage, Turreau could explain it only as due to the
natural defects of “a motley people, that will never
have true patriotism, because it has no object of common
interest;” a nation which looked on the most
shameless outrages of its own virtue as only “unfortunate
events.” Yet one point remained which, although
to every American it seemed most natural,
was incomprehensible to the Frenchman, whose anger
with America was due not so much to the dependence
of the United States on England, as to their independence
of France.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What will doubtless astonish those who know the
Americans but imperfectly, and what has surprised me
myself,—me, who have a very bad opinion of this people,
and who believe it just,—is the aversion (<i>éloignement</i>)—and
I soften the word—which it has preserved
for the French at the very moment when everything
should recall a glorious and useful memory. It is hardly
to be believed, yet is the exact truth, that in perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
five hundred banquets produced by the anniversary of
July 4, and among ten thousand toasts, but one has been
offered in favor of France; and even this was given
at an obscure meeting, and was evidently dictated by
Duane.”</p>
</div>

<p>Even the Administration press, Turreau complained,
had thought proper to repudiate the idea
of a French alliance. From his complaints the truth
could be easily understood. In spite of reason, and
in defiance of every ordinary rule of politics, France
possessed in America no friend, or influence. The
conclusion to be drawn was inevitable. If the United
States would not accept the only alliance which
could answer their purpose, England had nothing to
fear. “In this state of affairs and condition of minds,
it appears to me difficult to believe that Congress
will take measures vigorous enough to revenge the
insult offered to the Union, and to prevent the renewal
of outrages.”</p>

<p>This conclusion was reached by Turreau September
4, while as early as September 1 the same opinion
was expressed by Erskine, the British minister:<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From all the consideration which I have been able to
give to the present state of things in this country, I am
confirmed most strongly in the opinion which I have ventured
to express in my former despatches, that, although
I fear it might be possible for this government to lead
the people into a war with Great Britain on the point of
searching her national armed ships, yet I do not believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
that there are any other grounds which would be powerful
enough to urge them to so dangerous a measure to
the political existence perhaps, but certainly to the general
prosperity of this country.”</p>
</div>

<p>No two men in America were better informed or
more directly interested than Turreau and Erskine,
and they agreed in regarding America as passive
in the hands of England.</p>

<p>During the month of September the news from
Europe tended to show that while England would
not sustain the attack on the “Chesapeake,” she
meant to cut off, for her own benefit, another share
of American commerce. The report on the West
Indian trade and the debates in Parliament foreshadowed
the enforcement of the so-called Rule of
1756 or some harsher measure. That Congress must
in some way resent this interference with neutral
rights was evident, unless America were to become
again a British province. Erskine knew the strength
of British influence too well to fear war; but he
warned his Government that no nation could be expected
to endure without protest of some kind the
indignities which the United States daily experienced:<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am persuaded that more ill-will has been excited in
this country toward Great Britain by a few trifling illegal
captures immediately off this coast, and some instances
of insulting behavior by some of his Majesty’s naval
commanders in the very harbors and waters of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
States, than by the most rigid enforcement of the maritime
rights of Great Britain in other parts of the world.
It may easily be conceived to be highly grating to the
feelings of an independent nation to perceive that their
whole coast is watched as closely as if it was blockaded,
and every ship coming in or going out of their harbors
examined rigorously in sight of the shore, by British
squadrons stationed within their waters.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine added that the causes of difference were so
various as to make any good understanding improbable,
and any commercial treaty impossible; that the
Federalists thought even worse of Monroe’s treaty
than the Government did, which rejected it; and
that a great sensation had been produced by the
late Report on the West Indian trade:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This point, and his Majesty’s Order in Council to
prohibit all neutral trade from port to port of his
Majesty’s enemies,—which, as you would perceive by
Mr. Madison’s letters on the subject, which have been
transmitted to you, has given great offence to this Government,—together
with the other points of difference
between the two countries, particularly that of the impressment
of British seamen out of American ships, will
be taken up by Congress upon their meeting at the close
of the present month; and I am fully convinced that
unless some amicable adjustment of these points of dispute
should previously take place, or be in a train to be
concluded, a system of commercial restrictions on the
trade of Great Britain with this country will be immediately
formed, and every step short of actual war taken to
show their dissatisfaction.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Thus, on the eve of the session, the most careful
critics agreed that Congress would avoid war, and
would resist England, if at all, by commercial measures.
The President and Madison, Turreau and Erskine,
were united in expecting the same course of
events. No one knew that Napoleon had enforced
against American commerce the provisions of his
Berlin Decree. France counted for nothing in the
councils of America; but the conduct of England
obliged Congress to offer some protest against aggression,—and
the easiest form of protest was a refusal
to buy what she had to sell. The moment for
testing Jefferson’s statesmanship had come; and at
no time since he became President had his theories
of peaceable coercion enjoyed so fair a prospect of
success. Abroad, Napoleon had shut the whole Continent
of Europe to English trade, which was henceforward
limited to countries beyond the seas. If
ever England could be coerced by peaceable means,
this was the time; while at home, the prospect
was equally favorable, for never in American history
had the authority of the government been so
absolute.</p>

<p>Jefferson’s hope of annihilating domestic opposition
was nearly gratified. In the three southernmost
States he had never met with serious attack; beyond
the Alleghanies, in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio,
his word was law; in Virginia, John Randolph grew
weaker day by day, and even with Monroe’s aid
could not shake the President’s popularity; Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
was torn by factions, but none of them troubled
Jefferson; New York, purged of Burr, was divided
between Clintons and Livingstons, who were united
in matters of national policy. The greatest triumph
of all was won in Massachusetts, where the election
of April, 1807, after calling out 81,500 voters, resulted
in the choice of the Democrat Sullivan over the head
of Governor Strong by about 42,000 votes against
39,000, and in the return of a Democratic majority
in the State legislature. Connecticut alone of the
New England States held to her old conservative
principles; but Connecticut was powerless without
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Still more decidedly the decline of organized opposition
was shown in the character of the Tenth Congress,
which was to meet October 26. Of the old
Federalist senators, Plumer of New Hampshire had
been succeeded by a Democrat; J. Q. Adams of
Massachusetts had publicly pledged himself to support
any measures of resistance to England; Tracy
of Connecticut—a very able opponent—was dead.
Only five senators could be rallied to partisan opposition
on matters of foreign policy,—Timothy
Pickering of Massachusetts; James Hillhouse and
Chauncey Goodrich of Connecticut; James A. Bayard
and Samuel White of Delaware. Pickering, who
considered Plumer and Adams as deserters to the
Administration, felt little confidence in Bayard; and
the event proved him right. There were limits
to Bayard’s partisanship; but even had he been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
willing to abet Pickering, four or five senators could
hope to effect little against a compact majority of
twenty-nine.</p>

<p>In the House the whole strength of opposition
could not control thirty votes, while Jefferson was
supported by one hundred and ten members or more.
The President was the stronger for Randolph’s
departure into decided opposition, where he could
no longer divide and mislead the majority, but must
act as a Federalist or alone. Of the twenty-four
Federalist members, Josiah Quincy was probably the
ablest speaker; but in the energy of his Federalism
he was rivalled by two men,—Barent Gardenier of
New York, and Philip Barton Key of Maryland,—who
were likely to injure their cause more than they
helped it.</p>

<p>In the country and in Congress, not only was
Jefferson supreme, but his enemies were prostrate.
Federalism in New England, for the first time, lay
helpless under his feet; Burr and the “little band”
in New York were crushed; the creoles in New
Orleans, and the Western revolutionists, with Wilkinson
at their head, were cowering before the outburst
of patriotism which struck their projects dead.
The hand of government rested heavily on them, and
threatened nobler prey. Even Chief-Justice Marshall
felt himself marked for punishment; while Monroe
and Randolph were already under ban of the republic.
These were triumphs which outweighed foreign disasters,
and warranted Jefferson in self-confidence; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
they were chiefly due to the undisputed success of
his financial management. Jefferson and Madison,
Dearborn and Robert Smith, might do what they
would, so long as they left Gallatin free to control
the results of their experiments; for Gallatin redeemed
the mistakes of his party. Madison’s foreign
policy had brought only trouble to the government;
Dearborn’s army had shown itself to be more
dangerous to the Union than to its enemies; Smith’s
gunboats were a laughing-stock; but Gallatin never
failed to cover every weak spot in the Administration,
and in October, 1807, the Treasury was profuse of
prosperity. Congress might abolish the salt tax and
Mediterranean Fund alike, and still the customs
would yield fourteen millions a year; while the sales
of public lands exceeded 284,000 acres and brought
another half million into the Treasury. December
31, after providing for all payments of public debt,
Gallatin had a balance of seven millions six hundred
thousand dollars on hand. During the Presidency
of Jefferson, twenty-five and a half millions had been
paid to redeem the principal of the public debt, and
only the restraints imposed by the law prevented
more rapid redemption. Even in case of war, Gallatin
offered to sustain it for a year without borrowing
money or increasing taxes.</p>

<p>There was the secret of Jefferson’s strength, of his
vast popularity, and of the fate which, without direct
act of his, never had failed to overwhelm his enemies.
The American people pardoned everything except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
an empty Treasury. No foreign insults troubled
them long, and no domestic incompetence roused
their disgust; but they were sensitive to any taxation
which they directly felt. Gallatin atoned for starving
the government by making it rich; and if obliged
to endure disgrace and robbery abroad, he gave the
President popularity at home. Conscious of this
reserved strength, the President cared the less for
foreign aggressions. His was, according to theory,
the strongest government on earth; and at worst he
had but to withdraw from intercourse with foreign
nations in order to become impregnable to assault.
He had no misgivings as to the result. When he
returned, about October 8, from Monticello to Washington,
his only thought was to assert the strength
he felt. Nothing had then been received from England
in regard to the “Chesapeake” negotiation,
except Canning’s letter of August 3, promising to
“make reparation for any alleged injury to the sovereignty
of the United States, whenever it should be
clearly shown that such injury has been actually sustained,
and that such reparation is really due.” The
President justly thought that this letter, though it
disavowed the pretension to search ships of war, held
out no sufficient hope of reparation for the “Chesapeake”
outrage; and in writing the first draft of
his Message, he expressed strongly his irritation at
the conduct of England. The draft was sent, as
usual, to the members of his Cabinet, and called out
a remonstrance from Gallatin:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Instead of being written in the style of the proclamation,
which has been almost universally approved at
home and abroad, the Message appears to me to be rather
in the shape of a manifesto, issued against Great Britain
on the eve of a war, than such as the existing undecided
state of affairs seems to require. It may either be construed
into a belief that justice will be denied,—a result
not to be anticipated in an official communication,—or
it may be distorted into an eagerness of seeing matters
brought to issue by an appeal to arms.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In truth, the draft rather showed that Jefferson
was ready to see matters brought to an issue, provided
that the issue should not be an appeal to arms.</p>

<p>A few days later, after Congress met, Gallatin
wrote to his wife:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The President’s speech was originally more warlike
than was necessary; but I succeeded in getting it neutralized—this
between us; but it was lucky, for Congress
is certainly peaceably disposed.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The situation lay in these few words. Not only
Congress but also the Government and people were
peaceably disposed; and between the attitude of
Congress and that of the President was but the
difference that the former knew not what to do,
while the latter had a fixed policy to impose. “I
observe among the members,” wrote a non-partisan
senator, “great embarrassment, alarm, anxiety, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
confusion of mind, but no preparation for any measure
of vigor, and an obvious strong disposition to
yield all that Great Britain may require, to preserve
peace under a thin external show of dignity and
bravery.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In such a state of minds, and with such
a reserve of popular authority, President Jefferson’s
power found no restraint.</p>

<p>Such was the situation October 26, when Congress
assembled in obedience to the President’s call. An
unusually large number of members attended on the
opening day, when for the first time the House was
installed in a chamber of its own. After seven
years of residence at Washington, the government
had so far completed the south wing of the Capitol
as to open it for use. A covered way of rough
boards still connected the Senate Chamber in the
north wing with the Chamber of Representatives in
the southern extension of the building, and no one
could foresee the time when the central structure,
with its intended dome, would be finished; but the
new chamber gave proof that the task was not
hopeless. With extraordinary agreement every one
admitted that Jefferson’s and Latrobe’s combined
genius had resulted in the construction of a room
equal to any in the world for beauty and size. The
oval hall, with its girdle of fluted sandstone columns
draped with crimson curtains, its painted ceiling,
with alternate squares of glass, produced an effect
of magnificence which was long remembered. Unfortunately,
this splendor had drawbacks. Many and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
bitter were Randolph’s complaints of the echoes and
acoustic defects which marred the usefulness of the
chamber.</p>

<p>That Randolph should feel no love for it was natural.
The first scene it witnessed was that of his
overthrow. Macon, who for six years had filled the
chair, retired without a contest, dragged down by
Randolph’s weight; and of the one hundred and seventeen
members present, fifty-nine, a bare majority,
elected Joseph Bradley Varnum of Massachusetts
their Speaker; while the minority of fifty-eight scattered
their votes among half-a-dozen candidates.
Varnum, ignoring Randolph, appointed George Washington
Campbell of Tennessee chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee. Troublesome as the Virginia
leader had been, he was still the only member competent
to control the House, and his fall was greatly
regretted by at least one member of the Cabinet.
“Varnum has, much against my wishes, removed
Randolph from the Ways and Means, and appointed
Campbell of Tennessee,” wrote Gallatin.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> “It was
improper as related to the public business, and will
give me additional labor.”</p>

<p>October 27 the President’s Message was read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The love of peace,” it began, “so much cherished in
the bosoms of our citizens, which has so long guided the
proceedings of their public councils and induced forbearance
under so many wrongs, may not insure our continuance
in the quiet pursuits of industry.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>
<p>An account of Monroe’s negotiation and treaty
followed this threatening preamble; and the warmest
friends of Monroe and Pinkney could hardly find
fault with the President’s gentle comments on their
conduct.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After long and fruitless endeavors to effect the purposes
of their mission, and to obtain arrangements within
the limits of their instructions, they concluded to sign
such as could be obtained, and to send them for consideration;
candidly declaring to their other negotiators, at
the same time, that they were acting against their instructions,
and that their Government, therefore, could
not be pledged for ratification.”</p>
</div>

<p>The provisions of the proposed treaty proved to be,
in certain points, “too highly disadvantageous,” and
the minister had been instructed to renew negotiation.
The attack on the “Chesapeake” followed,
aggravated by the defiant conduct of the British
commanders at Norfolk. Lord Howick’s Order in
Council had swept away by seizures and condemnations
the American trade in the Mediterranean.
Spain, too, had issued a decree in conformity with
Napoleon’s decree of Berlin. Of France alone no
complaint was made, and the President could even
say that commerce and friendly intercourse had been
maintained with her on their usual footing. He had
not yet heard of the seizures made two months before,
by Napoleon’s order, in the ports of Holland.</p>

<p>In the face of these alarming events, it had been
thought better to concentrate all defensive resources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
on New York, Charleston, and New Orleans; to
purchase such military stores as were wanted in
excess of the supply on hand; to call all the gunboats
into service, and to warn the States to be ready with
their quotas of militia. “Whether a regular army is
to be raised, and to what extent, must depend on the
information so shortly expected.”</p>

<p>If this language had the meaning which in other
times and countries would have been taken for
granted, it implied a resort to measures of force
against foreign aggressions; yet neither the President
nor his party intended the use of force, except
for self-defence in case of actual invasion. The
Message was, in reality, silent in regard to peace and
war. The time had not yet come for avowing a
policy; but even had the crisis been actually at
hand, Jefferson would not have assumed the responsibility
of pointing out a policy to Congress. The
influence he exerted could rarely be seen in his
official and public language; it took shape in private,
in the incessant talk that went on, without witnesses,
at the White House.</p>

<p>More pointed than the allusion to England was the
menace to Chief-Justice Marshall. The threat against
the court, which the President made in the summer,
reappeared in the Message as a distinct invitation to
Congress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall think it my duty to lay before you the proceedings
and the evidence publicly exhibited on the
arraignment of the principal offenders before the Circuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Court of Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whether
the defect was in the testimony or in the law, or in the
administration of the law; and wherever it shall be
found, the Legislature alone can apply or originate the
remedy. The framers of our Constitution certainly supposed
they had guarded as well their government against
destruction by treason, as their citizens against oppression
under pretence of it; and if these ends are not
attained, it is important to inquire by what means more
effectual they may be secured.”</p>
</div>

<p>This strong hint was quickly followed up. Burr’s
trial at Richmond had hardly closed when the President
sent this Message to Congress; and within
another month, November 23, another Message was
sent, conveying a copy of the evidence and judicial
opinions given at the trial, on which Congressional
action might be taken.</p>

<p>So far as concerned foreign relations, no one could
say with certainty whether the Annual Message
leaned toward war or toward peace; but Gallatin’s
Report, which followed November 5, could be understood
only as an argument to show that if war was
to be made at all, it should be made at once. The
Treasury had a balance of seven or eight millions in
specie; the national credit was intact; taxes were
not yet reduced; the Bank was still in active
existence; various incidental resources were within
reach; the first year of war would require neither
increase of debt nor of taxation, and for subsequent
years loans, founded on increased customs duties,
would suffice. Calmly and easily Gallatin yielded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the impulse of the time, and dropping the objects for
which—as he said—he had been brought into
office, took up again the heavy load of taxation and
debt which his life had been devoted to lightening.
No one could have supposed, from his language in
1807, that within only ten years he and his party had
regarded debt as fatal to freedom and virtue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An addition to the debt is doubtless an evil,” he informed
Congress; “but experience having now shown
with what rapid progress the revenue of the Union increases
in time of peace, with what facility the debt
formerly contracted has in a few years been reduced,
a hope may confidently be entertained that all the evils
of the war will be temporary and easily repaired, and
that the return of peace will, without any effort, afford
ample resources for reimbursing whatever may have been
borrowed during the war.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Gallatin was so willing to abandon his dogma,
the Federalists might at least be forgiven for asking
why he had taken it up. For what practical object
had he left the country helpless and defenceless for
six years in order to pay off in driblets the capital of
a petty debt which, within much less than a century,
could be paid in full from the surplus of a single
year? The success of his policy depended on the
correctness of Jefferson’s doctrine, that foreign nations
could be coerced by peaceable means into
respect for neutral rights; but Gallatin seemed to
have already abandoned the theory of peaceable
coercion before it had been tried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>The same conflict of ideas was felt in Congress,
which had nothing to do but to wait for news from
Europe that did not arrive. The month of November
was passed in purposeless debate. That the time
had come when some policy must be adopted for
defending the coasts and frontiers was conceded, but
no policy could be contrived which satisfied at once
the economical and the military wants of the country.
In this chaos of opinions, Jefferson alone held fixed
theories; and as usual his opinions prevailed. He
preferred gunboats to other forms of armament, and
he had his way.</p>

<p>The Cabinet had not adopted the gunboat policy
without protest. When in the preceding month of
February the President sent to Congress his Message
recommending that two hundred gunboats should be
built, at a cost, as Gallatin thought, of a million
dollars, the secretary remonstrated. In his opinion
not one third that number were needed in peace,
while in case of war any required number could
be built within thirty days. “Exclusively of the first
expense of building and the interest of the capital
thus laid out, I apprehend that, notwithstanding the
care which may be taken, they will infallibly decay
in a given number of years, and will be a perpetual
bill of costs for repairs and maintenance.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
President overruled these objections, affirming that
the necessary gunboats could not be built even in
six months; that after the beginning of a war they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
could not be built in the seaports, “because they
would be destroyed by the enemy on the stocks;”
and the first act of the enemy “would be to sweep
all our seaports of their vessels at least;” finally, the
expense of building and preserving them would be
trifling.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Gallatin did not persist in the argument.
Jefferson was determined to have gunboats, and gunboats
were built.</p>

<p>The “Chesapeake” disaster riveted the gunboat
policy on the government. Nearly every one, except
the Federalists, agreed in Randolph’s unwillingness
to vote money for the support of a “degraded
and disgraced navy.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Robert Smith made no apparent
attempt to counteract this prejudice; he
sacrificed the frigates for gunboats. October 22,
1807, at a full Cabinet meeting, according to Jefferson’s
memoranda, the following order was taken
in regard to the frigates, in view of war with
England:<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ‘Constitution’ is to remain at Boston, having
her men discharged; the ‘Wasp’ is to come to New
York; the ‘Chesapeake’ to remain at Norfolk; and the
sending the ‘United States’ frigate to New York is reserved
for further consideration, inquiring in the mean
time how early she could be ready to go. It is considered
that in case of war these frigates would serve as
receptacles for enlisting seamen, to fill the gunboats
occasionally.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>A government which could imagine no other use
for its frigates than as receiving ships for gunboats
in time of war naturally cared to build none. When
Congress took up the subject of naval defence, gunboats
alone were suggested by the department.
November 8 Robert Smith wrote to Dr. Mitchill,
chairman of the Senate Committee on defences, a
letter asking for eight hundred and fifty thousand
dollars to build one hundred and eighty-eight more
gunboats in order to raise the whole number to two
hundred and fifty-seven.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> A bill was at once introduced,
passed the Senate without a division, and went
to the House, where the Federalists sharply assailed
it. Randolph ridiculed the idea of expelling by such
means even so small a squadron as that which at
Lynnhaven Bay had all summer defied the power of
the United States. Josiah Quincy declared that except
for rivers and shallow waters these gunboats
were a danger rather than a defence; and that at
all times and places they were uncomfortable, unpopular
in the service, and dangerous to handle and
to fight. Imprisonment for weeks, months, or years
in a ship of the line was no small hardship, but
service in a coop not wide enough to lie straight in,
with the certainty of oversetting or running ashore
or being sunk, in case of bad weather or hostile attack,
was a duty intolerable to good seamen and fatal
to the navy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>
<p>All this and much more was true. Fulton’s
steamer, the “Clermont,” with a single gun would
have been more effective for harbor defence than all
the gunboats in the service, and if supplemented by
Fulton’s torpedoes would have protected New York
from any line-of-battle ship; but President Jefferson,
lover of science and of paradox as he was, suggested
no such experiment. By the enormous majority of
111 to 19, the House, December 11, passed the bill
for additional gunboats. A million dollars were
voted for fortifications. In all, an appropriation of
one million eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars
for defences was the work accomplished by Congress
between October 26 and December 18, 1807. In face
of a probable war with England, such action was
equivalent to inaction; and in this sense the public
accepted it.</p>

<p>While Congress wrangled about systems of defence
almost equally inefficient,—gunboats and frigates,
militia and volunteers, muskets, movable batteries,
and fixed fortifications,—the country listened with
drawn breath for news from England. Time dragged
on, but still the “Revenge” did not return. About
the end of November, despatches<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> dated October 10
arrived from Monroe, announcing that Canning refused
to couple the “Chesapeake” affair with the impressment
of merchant seamen; that he was about to
send a special envoy to Washington with the exclusive
object of settling the “Chesapeake” affair; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Monroe had taken his final audience of King George,
and that William Pinkney was henceforward sole
minister of the United States in London. Of the
treaty not a hope seemed to exist. Monroe’s return
was ominous of failure.</p>

<p>Erskine, uneasy at hearing these reports, hastened
to the White House, and without delay reported Jefferson’s
conversation to his Government:<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I found from my interview with the President that
he was much disappointed at the result of the discussions
which had taken place, and, as he expressed himself,
greatly alarmed by some of the passages in your letters
that a satisfactory redress of the injuries complained of
was not likely to be afforded to the United States. He
informed me that the reasons which had induced him to
instruct the American ministers to endeavor to obtain
some arrangement upon the point of impressment of
British seamen out of American ships, at the same time
that a reparation for the attack on the ‘Chesapeake’ by
his Majesty’s ship ‘Leopard’ was demanded, were that
he conceived that if a satisfactory security against the
injuries arising to the United States from such impressments
could have been obtained, a redress for the attack
upon their national ship would have been much easier
settled; but that if the point of honor was to be taken
into consideration by itself, he foresaw greater difficulties
in the way of an amicable adjustment of it.... The
President further observed, however, that although he
feared the separating the two subjects would increase
the difficulty of the negotiation, and that he considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the determination of his Majesty’s government to postpone
the consideration of the point of impressment—which
he said was the most serious ground of difference—as
an unfavorable symptom of their ultimate intentions
upon that subject, yet that he certainly would
not refuse upon the ground of form only that the affair
of the ‘Chesapeake’ should be first concluded; but expressed
a hope that the minister who should be sent to
this country to settle that subject of complaint should
also be invested by his Majesty with powers to negotiate
upon the point of impressment.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sanguine temperament which challenged a duel
accorded ill with the afterthought which shrank from
it. Voluntarily, coolly, with mature reflection, Jefferson
had invited Canning’s blow; and when Canning
struck, Jefferson recoiled. Monroe might well claim
that such conditions as were imposed on him should
never have been made, or should never have been
withdrawn; that at moments of violent irritation no
nation could afford to tease another with demands
not meant to be enforced.</p>

<p>To increase the President’s embarrassment, the
Secretary of War Dearborn made a natural mistake.
The original instructions to Monroe, decided in Cabinet
meeting July 2,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> did not connect the “Chesapeake”
outrage with impressments of merchant seamen.
Neither July 4 nor July 5, when full Cabinet
meetings were held, did the subject come up.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The
final instructions, dated July 6, changed the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
demand by extending the required redress over all
cases of impressment; but meanwhile General Dearborn
had left Washington for New York, and was
not told of the change.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> So it happened that when
in October the Federalist newspapers began to attack
Jefferson, on the authority of the English press, for
coupling the subject of general impressment with the
attack on the “Chesapeake,” Dearborn, who chanced
to be in Massachusetts, denied the charge; and on
his authority the Republican newspapers asserted that
the alleged instructions had not been given. This
denial created no little confusion among Republicans,
who could not understand why the instructions had
been changed, or on what ground the Administration
meant to defend them.</p>

<p>In truth, the change had been an afterthought,
founded on the idea that as abandonment of impressments
was a <i>sine qua non</i> in the commercial negotiation,
and a point on which the Government meant
inflexibly to insist, it should properly be made a <i>sine
qua non</i> in this or any other agreement.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> This decision
had been made in July, with knowledge that
England would rather fight than yield a point so
vital to her supposed interests. In December, on
hearing that Canning refused to yield, the President
told Erskine that the <i>sine qua non</i>, so formally
adopted, would be abandoned.</p>

<p>That conduct in appearance so vacillating should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
perplex Jefferson’s friends and irritate his enemies
was natural; but in reality nothing vacillating was in
the President’s mind. These negotiations were but
outpost skirmishes, and covered his steady retreat to
the fortress which he believed to be impregnable.
He meant to coerce Canning, but his method of coercion
needed neither armies nor negotiators. While
telling Erskine that the <i>sine qua non</i> should not prevent
a settlement of the “Chesapeake” affair, he set
in motion the first of the series of measures which
were intended to teach England to respect American
rights.</p>

<p>December 14, against strong remonstrances from
the merchants, the Non-importation Act of April 18,
1806, went into effect. The exact amount of British
trade affected by that measure was not known. All
articles of leather, silk, hemp, glass, silver, paper,
woollen hosiery, ready-made clothing, millinery, malt
liquors, pictures, prints, playing-cards, and so forth,
if of English manufacture, were henceforward prohibited;
and any person who had them in his possession
incurred forfeiture and fine. The measure was
in its nature coercive. The debates in Congress
showed that no other object than that of coercion
was in the mind of the American government; the
history of the Republican party and the consistent
language of Jefferson, Madison, and the Virginian
school proclaimed that the policy of prohibition
was their substitute for war. England was to be
punished, by an annual fine of several million dollars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
for interference with American trade to the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>Two days after this law went into effect Madison
received from the British government a document
which threw the Non-importation Act into the background,
and made necessary some measure more
energetic. The King’s proclamation of October 17,
requiring all British naval officers to exercise the
right of impressment to its full extent over neutral
merchant-vessels, was printed in the “National Intelligencer”
of December 17; and if Sir William
Scott’s decision in the case of the “Essex” required
the Non-importation Act as its counterpoise, the Impressment
Proclamation could be fairly balanced only
by a total cessation of relations.</p>

<p>In rapid succession the ships which had sailed a
month before from Europe arrived in American harbors,
after unusually quick voyages. Monroe, in the
“Augustus,” reached Norfolk December 13; the
“Edward” arrived at Boston December 12; the
“Brutus” got in at New York December 14, preceded
December 12 by the “Revenge.” All these
ships brought news to the same effect. Armstrong’s
despatches by the “Revenge” announced Napoleon’s
enforcement of the Berlin Decree. London newspapers
of November 12 agreed in predicting some
immediate and sweeping attack by the British government
upon American commerce; and from Pinkney
and Monroe came the official papers which put an
end to all hope of a commercial treaty with England.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Private letters bore out the worst public rumors.
Among other persons who were best informed as to
the intentions of the British government was Senator
Pickering of Massachusetts, whose nephew Samuel
Williams had been removed by Jefferson from the
London consulate, and remained in that city as an
American merchant, in connection with his brother
Timothy Williams of Boston. December 12 Timothy
Williams in Boston wrote to his uncle Senator Pickering
at Washington,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My brother writes me on the 9th of November ‘that
he was informed the Government would in a few days
declare Cuba, Martinique, and Guadeloupe in a state of
blockade, and restrict still more the trade of neutrals
with the Continent.’ The British no doubt had or would
issue an Order above referred to, to counteract our friend
Bonaparte’s decree of Nov. 21, 1806. I cannot however
think the intercourse with the Continent will be
entirely cut off. The influence of the West Indian planters
will procure the blockading of the enemy’s islands, no
doubt. What has not this country lost by the miserable
policy of the Administration! Your prudence will know
to whom you can or cannot communicate any of the above
paragraphs.”</p>
</div>

<p>“With much solicitude respecting the present state
of things,” Timothy Williams concluded this letter of
warning; and his anxiety was shared by every one
who read the newspapers which proclaimed the danger
of war. At Washington the alarming news
arrived December 17, at the heels of the Impressment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Proclamation. The President instantly called his
Cabinet together. Under less serious circumstances
in 1794, Congress had imposed an embargo for thirty
days, forbidding clearances to all foreign-bound vessels
while the question of war or peace was deciding.
By common consent an embargo was the proper measure
to be taken in the face of an expected attack on
commerce. On reading the news from France and
England, every one assumed that an embargo would
be imposed until the exact nature of the French and
British aggressions should be learned; but safe precedent
required that the law should restrict its own
operation within some reasonable limit of time. An
embargo for thirty or sixty days, or even for three
months, might be required before reaching some decision
as to peace or war.</p>

<p>On a loose sheet of letter-paper, which happened
to bear the address of General Mason, the President
wrote a hasty draft of an embargo message to Congress.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
After referring to Armstrong’s despatch announcing
the Emperor’s decision to enforce the Berlin
Decree, Jefferson’s draft noticed the threatened orders
of England:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The British regulations had before reduced us to a
direct voyage to a single port of their enemies, and it is
now believed they will interdict all commerce whatever
with them. A proclamation, too, of that Government
(not officially, indeed, communicated to us, yet so given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
out to the public as to become a rule of action with them)
seems to have shut the door on all negotiation with us,
except as to the single aggression on the ‘Chesapeake.’
The sum of these mutual enterprises on our national
rights is that France and her allies, reserving for future
consideration the prohibiting our carrying anything to
the British territories, have virtually done it by restraining
our bringing a return cargo from them; and Great
Britain, after prohibiting a great proportion of our
commerce with France and her allies, is now believed
to have prohibited the whole. The whole world is thus
laid under interdict by these two nations, and our vessels,
their cargoes, and crews are to be taken by the one or
the other for whatever place they may be destined out
of our own limits. If, therefore, on leaving our harbors
we are certainly to lose them, is it not better, as to
vessels, cargoes, and seamen, to keep them at home?
This is submitted to the wisdom of Congress, who alone
are competent to provide a remedy.”</p>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, no official document could be produced
in proof of the expected British interdict, and
mere newspaper paragraphs could not be used for the
purpose. To avoid this difficulty Madison wrote, in
pencil, another draft which omitted all direct mention
of the expected British order. He proposed to send
Congress the official letter in which the Grand Judge
Regnier announced that the Berlin Decree would be
enforced, and with this letter a copy of the British
Impressment Proclamation as printed in the “National
Intelligencer.” On these two documents he
founded his draft of a Message:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The communications now made showing the great
and increasing danger with which our merchandise, our
vessels, and our seamen are threatened on the high seas
and elsewhere by the belligerent Powers of Europe, and
it being of the greatest importance to keep in safety these
essential resources, I deem it my duty to recommend the
subject to the consideration of Congress, who will doubtless
perceive all the advantages which may be expected
from an immediate inhibition of the departure of our
vessels from the ports of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Cabinet, every member being present, unanimously
concurred in the recommendation to Congress;<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
but at least one member would have preferred
that the embargo should be limited in time.
The Cabinet meeting was held in the afternoon or
evening of December 17, and early the next morning
Gallatin wrote to the President suggesting a slight
change in the proposed measure, and adding a serious
warning which Jefferson would have done well
to regard:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I also think,” said Gallatin,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> “that an embargo for
a limited time will at this moment be preferable in itself
and less objectionable in Congress. In every point of
view—privations, sufferings, revenue, effect on the enemy,
politics at home, etc.—I prefer war to a permanent
embargo. Governmental prohibitions do always more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
mischief than had been calculated; and it is not without
much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate
the concerns of individuals, as if he could do it better
than themselves. The measure being of a doubtful policy,
and hastily adopted on the first view of our foreign
intelligence, I think that we had better recommend it with
modifications, and at first for such a limited time as will
afford us all time for reconsideration, and if we think
proper, for an alteration in our course without appearing
to retract. As to the hope that it may have an effect on
the negotiation with Mr. Rose, or induce England to treat
us better, I think it entirely groundless.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this remarkable letter the President immediately
replied by summoning the Cabinet together at
ten o’clock in the morning.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> No record of the consultation
was preserved; but when the Senate met at
noon the Message was read by the Vice-president as
it had been shaped by Madison. The suggestion of
Gallatin as to a limit of time had not been adopted.</p>

<p>The Senate instantly referred the Message to a
committee of five, with General Smith and J. Q.
Adams at its head:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We immediately went into the committee-room,” recorded
Senator Adams in his Diary,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> “and after some
discussion, in which I suggested very strong doubts as to
the propriety of the measure upon the papers sent with
the President’s Message, I finally acquiesced in it as a
compliance with the special call for it in the Message.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
I inquired whether there were other reasons for it besides
the diplomatic papers sent with the Message, as <i>they</i>
appeared to me utterly inadequate to warrant such a
measure. Smith, the chairman, said that the President
wanted it to aid him in the negotiation with England
upon which Mr. Rose is coming out, and that perhaps it
might enable us to get rid of the Non-importation Act.
I yielded. But I believe there are yet other reasons,
which Smith did not tell. There was no other opposition
in committee.”</p>
</div>

<p>Senator Adams was right in believing that other
reasons existed; but although the “National Intelligencer”
of the same morning had published the warnings
of British newspapers,—doubtless in order to
affect the action of Congress,—no one of the Republican
senators seemed to rely on the expected British
order as the cause of the embargo. In foreign affairs
Jefferson maintained the reserve of a European monarch.
He alone knew what had been done or was
doing, and on him rested the whole responsibility of
action. The deference paid by the Senate to the
Executive in matters of foreign policy seemed patriotic,
but it proved fatal to one senator at least, whose
colleague had grievances to revenge. When the
committee, after a short deliberation, reported an
Embargo Bill, and some of the senators appealed for
delay, Adams, who was chafing under the delays
which had already lowered the self-respect of Government
and people, broke into a strenuous appeal for
energy. “The President has recommended the measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
on his high responsibility. I would not consider,
I would not deliberate; I would act!” The words
were spoken in secret session, but Senator Pickering
noted them for future use.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Among the antipathies
and humors of New-England politics none was more
characteristic than this personal antagonism, beginning
a new conspiracy which was to shake the Union
to its foundations.</p>

<p>The Senate agreed with the committee that if an
embargo was to be laid it should be laid promptly;
and the bill, probably drawn by the President, passed
through its three stages on the same day, by a vote
of twenty-two to six. At the second reading it was
strongly opposed by Hillhouse, Pickering, and Sumter
of South Carolina; while William H. Crawford, the
new senator from Georgia, asked only time for consideration.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Within four or five hours after hearing
the Message read, the Senate sent its Embargo Act
to the House.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the House also had received the President’s
Message, and had, like the Senate, gone at once
into secret session. No sooner was the Message read
than John Randolph and Jacob Crowninshield sprang
at the same moment to their feet. The Speaker recognized
Randolph, who instantly offered a Resolution,
“that an embargo be laid on all shipping, the property
of citizens of the United States, now in port,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
or which shall hereafter arrive.” After some time
passed in discussion, on receiving the Senate bill the
House laid Randolph’s Resolution aside, and in secret
session began a long and warm debate, which
continued all day, and was not concluded on Saturday,
December 19, when the House adjourned over
Sunday.</p>

<p>The loss of this debate was unfortunate; for no
private citizen ever knew the reasons which Congress
considered sufficient to warrant a strain of the Constitution
so violent as a permanent embargo implied.
The debate was certainly dramatic: it was not only
the first great political crisis witnessed in the new
scenery of the Representatives’ Chamber, but it also
brought John Randolph forward in an attitude which
astonished even those who had witnessed the Virginian’s
growing eccentricity. On Friday Randolph
“scrambled” with Crowninshield for the floor, eager
to force on the House a policy of embargo which he
had again and again recommended as the only proper
measure of national defence. On Saturday he rose
again, but only to denounce his own measure as one
that crouched to the insolent mandates of Napoleon,
and led to immediate war with England.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The cry of
French influence, raised by him and by the Federalist
members, began on that day, and echoed in louder
and louder tones for years.</p>

<p>On Monday, December 21, the debate closed, and
the House consumed the day in voting. Amendment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
after amendment was rejected. Most significant of
all these votes was the list of yeas and nays on the
question of limiting the embargo to the term of two
months. Forty-six members voted in the affirmative;
eighty-two in the negative. The New England
and Pennsylvania Democrats obeyed the wishes of
Jefferson, and riveted a permanent embargo on
the people, without public discussion of the principle
or explanation of the effect which was expected
from a measure more trying than war itself to patriotism.
The bill then passed by a vote of eighty-two
to forty-four.</p>

<p>So small a part was played in this debate by the
expected Order in Council that members afterward
disputed whether the subject was mentioned at all.
Probably the Administration preferred silence in
public, either for fear of prejudicing the expected
negotiation with Rose, or of weakening the effect
of arguments which without the order were sufficiently
strong; but in private no such reticence was
shown. The British minister on Monday, before the
bill had become law, notified Canning not only that
an embargo was about to be laid, but of the cause
which produced the measure:<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has been confidentially communicated to me that
an embargo on all the shipping in the United States has
been proposed in Congress, and although it is strongly
resisted, it is expected that it will be carried, on the
ground of expecting that a proclamation by his Majesty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
will be issued declaring France and her dependencies in
a state of blockade. I hasten to send you this letter for
fear of the effect of an embargo.”</p>
</div>

<p>The person from whom Erskine received this confidential
communication was probably the Secretary of
State; for two days afterward, when the British minister
wrote to say that the embargo had been laid,
he added:<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I propose to send off his Majesty’s packet-boat with
this intelligence immediately, and avail myself of this
opportunity by a private ship to inform you that the embargo
is not intended, as this Government declares, as a
measure of hostility against Great Britain, but only as
a precaution against the risk of the capture of their ships
in consequence of the decree of Bonaparte of Nov. 21,
1806, which they have just learned is to be rigorously enforced;
and also from an apprehension of a retaliatory
order by Great Britain.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the embargo was imposed; and of all President
Jefferson’s feats of political management, this
was probably the most dexterous. On his mere recommendation,
without warning, discussion, or publicity,
and in silence as to his true reasons and motives,
he succeeded in fixing upon the country, beyond
recall, the experiment of peaceable coercion. His triumph
was almost a marvel; but no one could fail to
see its risks. A free people required to know in advance
the motives which actuated government, and the
intended consequences of important laws. Large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
masses of intelligent men were slow to forgive what
they might call deception. If Jefferson’s permanent
embargo should fail to coerce Europe, what would the
people of America think of the process by which it
had been fastened upon them? What would be said
and believed of the President who had challenged
so vast a responsibility?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>December 22 Jefferson signed the Embargo Act;
four days afterward George Rose arrived at Norfolk.
The avowed object of his mission was to offer satisfaction
for the attack upon the “Chesapeake;” the
true object could be seen only in the instructions
with which he was furnished by Canning.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>These instructions, never yet published, began by
directing that in case any attempt should be made
to apply the President’s proclamation of July 2 to
Rose’s frigate, the “Statira,” he should make a formal
protest, and if the answer of the American
government should be unsatisfactory, or unreasonably
delayed, he should forthwith return to England.
Should no such difficulty occur, he was on arriving
at Washington to request an audience of the President
and Secretary of State, and to announce himself
furnished with full powers to enter into negotiation
on the “Chesapeake” affair, but forbidden to entertain
any proposition on any other point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With respect to that object, you will express your
conviction that the instructions under which you act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
would enable you to terminate your negotiation amicably
and satisfactorily. But you will state that you are distinctly
instructed, previously to entering into any negotiation,
to require the recall of the proclamation of the
President of the United States, and the discontinuance of
the measures which have been adopted under it.”</p>
</div>

<p>After explaining that the disavowal and recall of
Admiral Berkeley had taken away the excuse for
interdicting free communication with British ships,
and that thenceforward the interdict became an aggression,
Canning directed that if the request be
refused, Rose should declare his mission at an
end; but supposing the demand to be satisfied, he
was to disavow at once the forcible attack on the
“Chesapeake.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will state further that Admiral Berkeley has
been recalled from his command for having acted in an
affair of such importance without authority. You will
add that his Majesty is prepared to discharge those men
who were taken by this unauthorized act out of the
American frigate; reserving to himself the right of reclaiming
such of them as shall prove to have been deserters
from his Majesty’s service, or natural-born subjects
of his Majesty; and further, that in order to repair as
far as possible the consequences of an act which his
Majesty disavows, his Majesty is ready to secure to the
widows and orphans (if such there be) of such of the
men who were unfortunately killed on board the ‘Chesapeake’
as shall be proved not to have been British
subjects, a provision adequate to their respective situation
and condition in life.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>This disavowal, and the removal of Berkeley from
command, were to be the limit of concession. The
circumstances of provocation under which Berkeley
had acted, greatly extenuated his procedure; “and
his Majesty therefore commands me to instruct you
peremptorily to reject any further mark of his
Majesty’s displeasure toward Admiral Berkeley.”</p>

<p>The remainder of Canning’s instructions admits of
no abridgment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will next proceed to state that after this voluntary
offer of reparation on his Majesty’s part, his Majesty
expects that the Government of the United States will be
equally ready to remove those causes of just complaint
which have led to this unfortunate transaction.</p>

<p>“His Majesty requires this, not only as a due return
for the reparation which he has thus voluntarily tendered,
but as indispensable to any well-founded expectation of
the restoration and continuance of that harmony and
good understanding between the two governments which
it is equally the interest of both to cultivate and
improve.</p>

<p>“However much his Majesty may regret the summary
mode of redress which has been resorted to in the present
instance, it cannot be supposed that his Majesty is prepared
to acquiesce in an injury so grievous to his
Majesty as the encouragement of desertion from his
naval service.</p>

<p>“The extent to which this practice has been carried is
too notorious to require illustration; but the instance of
the ‘Chesapeake’ itself is sufficient to justify the demand
of adequate satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The protestation of Commodore Barron is contradicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
in the face of the world by the conviction and
confession of one of those unhappy men who had been
seduced from his allegiance to his Majesty, and to whom
Commodore Barron had promised his protection.</p>

<p>“His Majesty, however, does not require any proceeding
of severity against Commodore Barron; but he requires
a formal disavowal of that officer’s conduct in
encouraging deserters from his Majesty’s service, in retaining
them on board his ship, and in denying the fact
of their being there; and he requires that this disavowal
shall be such as plainly to show that the American government
did not countenance such proceedings, and to
deter any officer in their service from similar misconduct
in future.</p>

<p>“He requires a disavowal of other flagrant proceedings,—detailed
in papers which have been communicated to
you,—unauthorized, his Majesty has no doubt, but with
respect to which it ought to be known to the world that
the American government did not authorize and does not
approve them.</p>

<p>“You will state that such disavowals, solemnly expressed,
would afford to his Majesty a satisfactory pledge
on the part of the American government that the recurrence
of similar causes will not on any occasion impose
on his Majesty the necessity of authorizing those means
of force to which Admiral Berkeley has resorted without
authority, but which the continued repetition of such
provocations as unfortunately led to the attack upon the
‘Chesapeake’ might render necessary, as a just reprisal
on the part of his Majesty.</p>

<p>“And you will observe, therefore, that if the American
government is animated by an equally sincere desire with
that which his Majesty entertains to preserve the relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
of peace between the two countries from being
violated by the repetition of such transactions, they
can have no difficulty in consenting to make these
disavowals.</p>

<p>“This consent is to be the express and indispensable
condition of your agreeing to reduce into an authentic
and official form the particulars of the reparation which
you are instructed to offer.”</p>
</div>

<p>Rose came, not to conciliate, but to terrify. His
apology was a menace. So little was the President
prepared for such severity, that from the moment of
his consent to treat the “Chesapeake” affair by itself
he rather regarded the mission and reparation as a
formality. So completely had Monroe been beguiled
by Canning’s courteous manners, that no suspicion
of the truth crossed his mind or crept into his
despatches. No prominent American, except Giles,
ventured to hint that this mission of peace and
friendship was intended only to repeat the assertion
of supremacy which had led to the original offence.</p>

<p>George Henry Rose was chiefly remembered as the
father of Lord Strathnairn; but his merits were quite
different from those of his son. Without the roughness
which sometimes marked English character,
Rose’s manners betrayed a dignified and slightly
patronizing courteousness,—a certain civil condescension,—impressive
to Americans of that day, who
rarely felt at ease in the presence of an Englishman,
or were quite certain that an American gentleman
knew the habits of European society. Benevolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
superiority and quiet assumption, so studied as to be
natural and simple, were the social weapons with
which George Rose was to impose an unparalleled
indignity on a government which, in professing contempt
for forms, invited discourtesies. No man could
have been chosen with qualities better suited for
enforcing Canning’s will on the yielding moods of
Jefferson.</p>

<p>Rose’s first act after arriving in Hampton Roads
was to notify the President that he could not land
until assured that the proclamation of July 2 would
not be enforced against his ship. Canning had been
already officially informed that the proclamation expressly
excepted vessels on a service like that of the
“Statira,” as he might have seen for himself by
a moment’s inquiry; but his instructions were written
to suit the temper of Tory constituents. Rose
was obliged to wait from December 26 until January
9 before leaving his ship, while messengers carried
explanations and notes between Norfolk and
Washington.</p>

<p>Monroe, who sailed from England a day later than
Rose, reached Washington December 22. Rose arrived
only January 14. January 16 he was received
by the President, and made no complaint of the mode
of reception. In the four years that had passed since
Merry’s arrival, Jefferson had learned to be less strict
in Republican etiquette; but although Rose suffered
no indignity at the White House, he found much to
disapprove in the government. January 17, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
despatch to Canning, he mentioned that Congress
contained one tailor, one weaver, six or seven tavern-keepers,
four notorious swindlers, one butcher, one
grazier, one curer of hams, and several schoolmasters
and Baptist preachers.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The most aristocratic American of the twentieth
century will probably agree with the most extreme
socialist in admitting that Congress, in 1808, might
with advantage have doubled its proportion of tailors,
butchers, and swindlers, if by doing so it could have
lessened the number of its conspirators. To the
latter class belonged Senator Pickering, whose power
for mischief and whose appetite for intrigue combined
to make him a valuable ally for Rose. Within
forty-eight hours after Rose’s arrival, the senator from
Massachusetts had fallen under the fascination of the
British envoy’s manners and conversation. January
18 he wrote to his nephew Timothy Williams,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I now take up my pen merely to mention an unexpected
interview with Mr. Rose. I met him last Saturday
[January 16] at Georgetown, at the table of Mr.
Peter, whose lovely wife is a granddaughter of Mrs.
Washington. Mr. Rose’s face is indicative of a placid
temper, and his conversation confirms it. He possesses
good sense and a disposition perfectly conciliatory.
Such also is the disposition of the minister, Canning, by
whom he was selected for this mission. Canning was his
school-fellow and intimate friend. It seemed to me a
sort of friendly compulsion that sent him hither. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
a sacrifice for a domestic man who left a wife and seven
children behind him, and from whom he had never before
been separated. Thus much I gathered from his conversation
with me, which was marked with ease and candor;
indeed with singular openness, as if I had been an old
acquaintance. He expressed his surprise that the real
state of the negotiation with Mr. Monroe had not become
officially known to the people by an open communication
to Congress. No minister of Great Britain, he observed,
would have used such concealment as existed here. He
manifested a solicitude even to anxiety for a pacific adjustment
of all our differences. What our Government
will demand as a reparation for the attack on the ‘Chesapeake’
I do not know, nor what Mr. Rose is authorized
to concede; but I run no hazard in saying that nothing
in reality will be denied, and that if after all a war with
England should ensue, the fault will be our own.”</p>
</div>

<p>In giving this account of Rose’s singular openness
and candor, Senator Pickering did not repeat his own
remarks in the conversation; but they could be inferred
from the rest of his letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wrote last week to Mr. Cabot that I had the best
authority for saying that our Government had abandoned
the ground taken in London,—to treat of the ‘Chesapeake’
affair only in connection with the old subjects of
dispute. They have now determined to negotiate on this
separately, and even say that it is an affair by itself and
ought to be so treated. Perhaps they may demand that
Admiral Berkeley be brought to a British court-martial,—that
at any rate he be removed from command; and
that the three rascals of deserters who remain unhung
should be restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Confidence</i> now seems to be in Mr. Jefferson’s hands
as effectual in producing a compliance with his recommendations
as soldiers in the hands of Bonaparte in
procuring submission to his commands. With the like
implicit, blind confidence which enacted the Embargo, the
legislatures of Virginia and Maryland have approved it.
To this day if you ask any member of Congress the cause
and the object of the Embargo, he can give no answer
which common-sense does not spurn at. I have reason
to believe that Mr. Jefferson expected to get some credit
for it by having it ready just in time to meet the retaliating
order of England for Napoleon’s decree of Nov.
21, 1806. With much solicitude he, two or three weeks
ago, expressed his wonder that it did not arrive, apparently
desiring it as a material justification with the
people for the Embargo. He will doubtless be utterly
disappointed.”</p>
</div>

<p>That Jefferson in recommending the Embargo
had the Orders in Council in his mind was therefore
known to Pickering,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and was the general talk
of Federalists in Washington during the month which
followed the Embargo Act; but the orders themselves
reached America only the day after this letter was
written, and were published in the “National Intelligencer”
of January 22. In full view of the official
command that American trade with Europe should
pass through British ports and pay duty to the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Treasury, doubt as to the wisdom of an Embargo
seemed at an end. No further dispute appeared possible
except on the question whether or when the
Embargo should be raised in order to declare war.
Already, January 11, Senator Adams offered a Resolution
for appointing a committee to consider and report
when the Embargo could be taken off and vessels
permitted to arm; but the Senate silently rejected
the Resolution, January 21, by a vote of seventeen
to ten.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Neither decision nor debate on so serious a
point could be profitably undertaken before the result
of Rose’s diplomacy should be revealed.</p>

<p>Saturday, January 16, before meeting Senator Pickering
at dinner, Rose had delicately explained to Madison
that the President’s “Chesapeake” proclamation
was likely to prove a stumbling-block. In conversations
which consumed another week he urged its withdrawal,
while Madison replied that the exclusion of
British ships was not a punishment but a precaution,
that the “Leopard’s” attack was but one of its
causes, and that it was a measure taken in the interests
of peace. Argument against Canning’s positive
instructions answered no purpose. Rose could not
give way, and when he had been one week in Washington,
January 21, the negotiation was already at a
stand-still. There it would under any other Administration
have been permitted to remain. Rose had
come to offer an apology and to restore the captured
seamen. He had only to do this and go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Rose, after an interview with the Secretary of
State about January 21, waited until January 27
before writing to Canning. Then he resumed his
story:<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Within a few hours after my last conference with
Mr. Madison, an indirect and confidential communication
was made to me from one of the members of the Government
to the following purport: that the real difficulty
as to the recall of the proclamation was that of finding
grounds upon which the President could found his declared
motives for such a measure without exposing himself
to the charge of inconsistency and disregard of the
national honor, and without compromising his own personal
weight in the State; that it was earnestly wished that
I could make, as it were, a bridge over which he might
pass; and that I would develop just so much of the tenor
of my instructions as to the conditions of reparation as
might justify him in the course which I required should
be taken; that should however this be impossible, and
should the negotiation fail, the United States would not
commence war with Great Britain, but would continue
their Embargo, and adopting a sort of Chinese policy
would shut themselves up from the rest of the world;
that if we attacked them they would sally out just far
enough to repel us, and would invade Canada....
Communications of a similar nature were repeated to
me on subsequent days; and it did not seem advisable
to address Mr. Madison in writing until the utmost point
to which they would go was ascertained. At length I
had a conversation with the gentleman in question. He
avowed to me that what had passed was with the knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
of the President, whose difficulty arose from the
sacrifice of public opinion which he apprehended must
follow from the abandonment of the proclamation. He
said I must be aware how dear to Mr. Jefferson his
popularity must be, and especially at the close of his
political career, and that this consideration must be
held particularly in view by him; and he pressed me
earnestly to take such steps as would conciliate the
President’s wish to give his Majesty satisfaction on the
point in question and yet to maintain the possession of
what was pre-eminently valuable to him. He expressed
his own personal anxiety for the accommodation of the
present difference,—an anxiety heightened by his knowledge
that the United States had forever lost all hope of
obtaining the Floridas, the negotiation for them having
totally failed, and by his intimate persuasion that France
is the dormant owner of them. He said, moreover, that
since America could not obtain those provinces, he sincerely
wished to see them in the hands of Great Britain,
whose possession of them could never be anxious to the
United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>The supplications of this Cabinet minister were reinforced
by entreaties from leading Federalists, who
begged Rose not to follow a course which would aid
the President in rousing popular feeling against England;
but the British envoy could yield only so far
as not to break the negotiation abruptly. January
26 he wrote to the Secretary a note, in courteous
language announcing himself authorized to express
the conviction—which he certainly could not have
felt—that if the proclamation were withdrawn, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
should be able “to terminate the negotiation amicably
and satisfactorily.” Madison sent no answer
to the note, but kept the negotiation alive by private
interviews. January 29 Rose suggested the idea of
his friendly return to England with a representation
of the difficulty. Madison reported this suggestion
to the President, who on the following Monday, February
1, decided against the idea, preferring to yield
the point of dignity so far as to offer a recall of the
proclamation, conditional upon an informal disclosure
by Rose of the terms in which the atonement would
be made.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Throughout this tortuous affair Rose stood impassive.
He made no advance, offered no suggestion of
aid, showed no anxiety. Republicans and Federalists
crowded about him with entreaties and advice.
Rose listened in silence. Amateur diplomacy never
showed its evils more plainly than in the negotiation
with Rose; and when Madison allowed the
President to take the affair into his own hands,
employing another Cabinet officer to do what no Secretary
of State could permit himself to undertake,
the nuisance became a scandal. In the despatch of
January 27 Rose concealed the name of the deputy
Secretary of State; but in a despatch of February 6
he revealed it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should here add that a member of the Cabinet (the
Secretary of the Navy), who informed me that all his
communications with me were with the President’s knowledge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
assures me that a rupture with France is inevitable
and at hand.”</p>
</div>

<p>That Robert Smith acted in the matter as negotiator
for the President was afterward made known by
Jefferson himself.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Jefferson clung with touching pathos to the love
and respect of his fellow-citizens, who repaid his devotion
with equal attachment; but many an American
President who yearned no less passionately
for the people’s regard would have died an outcast
rather than have trafficked in their dignity and his
own self-respect in order to seek or save a personal
popularity. Perhaps Jefferson never knew precisely
what was said of him by his Secretary of the
Navy,—a passing remark by such a man as Robert
Smith, repeated through such a medium as George
Rose, need count for little; but the truth must be
admitted that in 1808—for the first and probably
for the last time in history—a President of the
United States begged for mercy from a British
minister.</p>

<p>In obedience to the President’s decision, Madison
yielded to the British demand on condition that the
Executive should not be exposed to the appearance
of having yielded.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> He arranged with Rose the
“bridge” which Robert Smith had previously prepared
for the President to cross. In a “secret and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
confidential” despatch dated Feb. 6, 1808, Rose explained
to Canning, with evident uneasiness, the
nature of the new proposal:<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The proposition made to me by Mr. Madison at the
close of our conference of yesterday was that he should
put into my hands a proclamation recalling the original
proclamation, sealed and signed by the President, bearing
date on the day of adjustment of differences, and conceived
in such terms as I should agree to; that on this
being done we should proceed to sign the instruments
adjusting the reparation. I answered that positive as
my instructions were to the effect I had invariably
stated to him, such was the knowledge I had of the
disposition of his Majesty’s government to act with the
utmost conciliation toward this country that I would
attempt the experiment, but premising distinctly that it
must be made unofficially through the whole of it, and
with the assurance of our mutual good faith to that
effect; and that as it must be completely and essentially
informal,—for the purpose of getting over difficulties
which appeared insuperable in any other way,—it
must be distinctly understood that if the attempt failed,
the regular and official communication must be resumed
on my explanatory note of January 26, and on that
alone.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the defence which Rose offered for thus disregarding
his instructions, the cause of his embarrassment
was plain. Duty required him to act as though
England had hitherto endured with magnanimity the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
wrongs inflicted by America, but might find herself
obliged soon to resent them. This attitude could
have been maintained against ordinary forms of diplomacy,
but Rose found himself stifled in the embraces
of men whose hatred was necessary to warrant his
instructions. He would gladly have assumed that
Madison’s concessions and Robert Smith’s cajoleries
were treacherous; but his Federalist friends, whose
interests were actively English, assured him that if
America could avoid a war with England, she would
inevitably drift into a war with France. The temptation
to show equal courtesy to that which was shown
to him, the instinctive shrinking from a harsh act,
the impossibility of obeying instructions without putting
himself in the wrong, and finally perhaps an incapacity
to understand the full humiliation implied in
his unrevealed demands,—led him to give way, and
to let Madison partially into the secret of Canning’s
instructions.</p>

<p>On the evening of February 5 Rose and Erskine
went to the house of the Secretary, and a draft of
the proposed proclamation was there offered to them
and accepted. The next day, at the Department, Rose
delicately began to reveal the further disavowals he
was instructed to demand. Even then he seemed
ashamed to betray the whole, but delayed and discussed,
knowing that he had done too much or too
little for the objects of his mission. Not until after
repeated interviews did he at last, February 14, mention
“with an apology for omitting it before, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
intended to do it,” that a disavowal of Commodore
Barron would be required.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>So cautious was Madison on his side that he offered
to make a part of the required disavowals, provided
these should be mutual. Rose declined this offer,
but proposed nothing more, and seemed rather to
invite a friendly failure of agreement. He ended
the conversation of February 14 by addressing to
Madison the usual words of rupture: “I will not
dissemble that I leave you with the most painful
impressions.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> February 16 Madison closed these
informal interviews with the dry remark that the
United States could not be expected to “make as
it were an expiatory sacrifice to obtain redress, or
beg for reparation.”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>The delay had strengthened Rose by weakening
the President. The embargo was beginning to work.
That the people should long submit to it was impossible,
reported Rose; even North Carolina was turning
against it. Monroe’s influence made itself felt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I learn this day,” wrote the British envoy February
17, “that Mr. Monroe has been indefatigable in
representing through Virginia the contrasted systems of
Great Britain and France in their true lights, the certain
destruction which must result to America from the
prevalence of the latter, and the necessity of uniting for
existence with the former. He has undoubtedly acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
a very strong party in that State,—it is now said a decided
majority in its legislature, and one entirely brought
over to the views above enounced.”</p>
</div>

<p>February 22, only a few days after the rupture of
negotiation, the Milan Decree arrived, and was published
in the “National Intelligencer.” This violent
act of Napoleon did much to divert popular indignation
from England. Under the influence of this good
fortune, Rose so little feared war as a consequence
of his failure that he speculated rather as to the
policy of accepting the United States as an ally:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would certainly be highly desirable,” he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
“that a rupture between France and America should
take place; but the latter under its present Constitution
and Administration could take but a very feeble part in
the warfare, and I know not if it is to be wished that
it should be roused to greater exertions, which must lead
to a more efficient form of government, a knowledge of
its strength, and the development of extensive views of
ambition.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nothing remained but to revert to Rose’s note of
January 26, and to close the affair by a formal correspondence.
No further attempt was made to conciliate
the British envoy, or to obtain concessions
from him; but February 24 he was told by Madison
of two steps to be taken by the Government which
bore on his negotiation. The President would recommend
to Congress an increase of the army to ten
thousand men, and a levy of twenty-four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
volunteers. Madison added that these were to be
considered as “measures of preparation, but not
as leading to war, or as directed against any particular
nation.” The Secretary added that an order
had been issued to discharge all British subjects
from national ships,—“an act of complaisance in
its effects which he observed Great Britain could
lay no claim to; which was done gratuitously,
but from views of policy and fitness entertained
by this Government.”</p>

<p>March 5 Madison at last sent his reply to Rose’s
note of January 26. After repeating the reasons
which forbade a withdrawal of the President’s proclamation,
the Secretary closed by informing Rose
that the President “has authorized me, in the event
of your disclosing the terms of reparation which you
believe will be satisfactory, and on its appearing that
they are so, ... to proceed to concert with you a
revocation of that act.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Rose waited till March
17, as though hoping for some further overture,
but finally replied, “It is with the most painful sensations
of regret that I find myself ... under the
necessity of declining to enter into the terms of
negotiation which by direction of the President you
therein offer.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Rose’s professions of regret were doubtless sincere.
Apart from the wish felt by every young diplomatist
to avoid the appearance of failure, Rose could not but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
see that his Government must wish to be relieved of
the three American seamen imprisoned at Halifax,
whose detention, admitted to be an act of violence,
must become a festering sore in the relations of
the two countries. That the American government
meant to profit by it was evident. By leaving the
“Chesapeake” affair unsettled, Rose played into the
hands of a national party. For the first time since
1794 language began to be used to a British minister
in the United States which he could not hear
without loss of dignity or sense of discredit. The
word “war” was semi-officially pronounced.</p>

<p>When on Monday, March 21, Rose made his parting
visits, he found the President silent; the Secretary of
State studiously avoided all political topics, while if
Rose’s report was accurate, Gallatin and Robert Smith
talked with intentional freedom.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury, has
little influence in the Government, though by far the
ablest and best informed member of it; and he probably
does not interfere materially beyond the limits of his
own department; but his utility in that department, in
which no adequate successor to him is contemplated, is
such that, as they feel they cannot do without him,
they are anxious to retain him at the head of it, and
consequently are obliged to keep him informed of their
proceedings.... Mr. Gallatin said at once and spontaneously
that <i>nothing</i> of real difficulty remained between
the two countries but his Majesty’s Orders in Council.
This he repeated twice, dwelling upon the word ‘nothing’
with particular emphasis. He added that if the belligerent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Powers persisted in enforcing their restrictions on
the neutral commerce, the embargo must be continued
until the end of the year, and that then America must
take part in the war; that England had officially declared
that she would revoke the restrictions she had imposed if
her enemy would do the same; but that though France
had professed as much, she had neither done it to the
minister of the United States at Paris nor directly to this
Government; neither had she made any communication
to it of her restrictive edicts, or relative to them; and
that this Government felt sensibly the difference of the
conduct held toward it by those of Great Britain and
France in those respects.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Gallatin’s assertion that if the Orders in Council
were enforced America within a year must declare
war, went far beyond any threat ever made before by
President Jefferson or his party. The Secretary of
the Navy held a somewhat different tone:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Smith told me that all would remain quiet if no
new vexations were committed on their coast, and that
the only measure which the Government would carry into
effect would be the levy of the body of regulars to consist
nominally of six thousand, but really of four thousand
men.”</p>
</div>

<p>Senator Giles and other Republican leaders avowed
readiness for war with England. Before Rose’s departure,
the new policy had become defined. Its first
object was to unite America in resisting England and
France; the second, to maintain the embargo till the
country should be ready for war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>
<p>With these ends in view, the Administration threw
aside the “Chesapeake” affair as a matter which
concerned England rather than America. Madison
notified Erskine that the subject had lost its consequence,
and that if England wished a settlement she
must seek it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It will throw some light upon the views of this Government,”
wrote Rose in his last despatch,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> “if I state
that in a recent conversation with Mr. Erskine, Mr.
Madison observed that since England has thus publicly
disclaimed the right of search of national ships for deserters,
and Admiral Berkeley has been recalled from
command of the Halifax squadron, although a more
formal mode of terminating the business would have
been more acceptable to this Government, it would consider
itself as satisfied on the restoration of the seamen
taken away by an act of force disavowed by his Majesty;
but that it would not again ask for reparation upon this
matter.”</p>
</div>

<p>From that moment all eyes turned toward the
embargo. The President had chosen his ground.
Unless his experiment succeeded, he might yet be
forced into the alternative of a second submission
or war.</p>

</div>


<p>All winter Congress waited for the result of Rose’s
negotiation. The huge majority, without leadership,
split by divergent interests, a mere mob guided from
the White House, showed little energy except for
debate, and no genius except for obedience.</p>

<p>The first political effect of the embargo was shown
in the increased virulence of debate. The Act of
December 22, passed on the spur of the moment, was
powerless to prevent evasions in the seaports, and
left untouched the trade with Canada and Florida. A
supplementary Act was necessary; but to warrant a
law for stopping all commerce by sea and land, the
Government could no longer profess a temporary purpose
of protecting ships, merchandise, and seamen,
but must admit the more or less permanent nature of
the embargo, and the policy of using it as a means
of peaceable coercion. The first Supplementary Act
passed Congress as early as January 8, but applied
only to coasting and fishing vessels, which were put
under heavy bonds and threatened with excessive penalties
in case of entering a foreign port or trading in
foreign merchandise. Finding that this measure was
not effective, and that neither England nor France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
showed a sign of relaxing the so-called system of
retaliation, Government was obliged to complete its
restrictions. February 11 the House instructed its
Committee of Commerce to inquire what further legislation
was necessary “to prevent the exportation of
goods, wares, and merchandise of foreign or domestic
growth or manufacture to any foreign port or place.”
The committee instantly reported a bill; and as
Rose’s negotiation broke down, February 19 the House
went into committee to debate a second supplementary
Embargo Act, which was to stop by land and sea
all commerce with the world.</p>

<p>The next day, February 20, Barent Gardenier of
New York, who surpassed Josiah Quincy in hatred of
the Administration, attacked the new bill in a speech
which showed much rough power and more temper.
He said with force that between the original
embargo and this Supplementary Act no connection
existed. The one was an embargo, the other was
non-intercourse; and he charged that the original
embargo was a fraud, intended to trick the country
into a permanent system of non-intercourse:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The more the original measure develops itself, the
more I am satisfied that my first view of it was correct;
that it was a sly, cunning measure; that its real object
was not merely to prevent our vessels from going out,
but to effect a non-intercourse. Are the nation prepared
for this? If you wish to try whether they are, tell them
at once what is your object. Tell them what you mean.
Tell them you mean to take part with the Grand Pacificator.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
Or else stop your present course. Do not go on
forging chains to fasten us to the car of the Imperial
Conqueror.”</p>
</div>

<p>Interrupted by a dozen Republican members who
leaped to their feet in anger, Gardenier for a time
returned to his argument and dropped the assertion
of subservience to Napoleon:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I ask the intelligent and candid men of this House
whether to prevent the farmers of Vermont from selling
their pigs in Canada is calculated to increase or diminish
our essential resources; whether the object which the
President professed to have in view is counteracted by a
traffic of this kind.... I could wish gentlemen would,
instead of bolting at me in the fulness of their rage,
endeavor to satisfy my poor understanding by cool reasoning
that they are right; that they would show me how
this measure will prepare us for war; how the weakening
by distressing every part of the country is to increase its
strength and its vigor.”</p>
</div>

<p>Had Gardenier stopped there, his argument would
have admitted no answer; but he had the defect of a
Federalist temper, and could not control his tongue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir, I cannot understand it. I am astonished,—indeed
I am astonished and dismayed. I see effects, but
I can trace them to no cause. Yes, sir, I do fear that
there is an unseen hand which is guiding us to the most
dreadful destinies,—unseen because it cannot endure
the light. Darkness and mystery overshadow this House
and this whole nation. We know nothing; we are permitted
to know nothing; we sit here as mere automata;
we legislate without knowing—nay, sir, without wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
to know—why or wherefore. We are told what we
are to do, and the Council of Five Hundred do it. We
move, but why or wherefore no man knows. We are
put in motion, but how I for one cannot tell.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gardenier was believed to be the author of a letter
written during the secret session, December 19, and
published in the “New York Evening Post,” which
began the cry of French influence.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> His speech of
February 20, insulting to the House, disorderly and
seditious, resting on innuendo but carrying the weight
of a positive assertion, outraged every member of the
majority. Even John Randolph had never gone so
far as to charge his opponents with being the willing
and conscious tools of a foreign despot. The House
was greatly exasperated, and at the next session,
Monday, February 22, three members—Richard M.
Johnson of Kentucky, George W. Campbell of Tennessee,
and John Montgomery of Maryland—rose
successively and declared that Gardenier’s expressions
were a slander, which if not supported by proof made
their author an object of contempt. Gardenier challenged
Campbell, and March 2 a duel took place at
Bladensburg. Gardenier was severely wounded, but
escaped with life, while the bitterness of party feeling
became more violent than before.</p>

<p>Yet no member ventured fairly to avow and defend
the policy of non-intercourse as a policy of coercion.
Campbell, the leader of the majority, admitted that
the embargo was intended to distress England and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
France, but treated it mainly as a measure of defence.
No full and fair discussion of the subject was attempted;
and the bill passed both Houses and was
approved by the President March 12, without calling
from the Government a hint in regard to the scope
of its policy or the length of time during which
the system of seclusion was to last. Even Jefferson
kept silence upon what was uppermost in his mind,
and defended the embargo on every ground except
that which with him, if with no one else, was strongest.
In private he said that the measure was intended
to last until the return of peace in Europe, or as long
as the orders and decrees of England and France
should be maintained:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Till they return to some sense of moral duty we
keep within ourselves. This gives time. Time may produce
peace in Europe; peace in Europe removes all
causes of difference till another European war; and by
that time our debt may be paid, our revenues clear, and
our strength increased.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
</div>

<p>With such reasoning the opponents of the embargo
were far from pleased. Nevertheless, Jefferson carried
his point, and could for the moment afford to
disregard criticism. His experiment of peaceable
coercion was sure of a trial. His control over Congress
seemed absolute. Only twenty-two members
voted against the Supplementary Embargo Act, and
in the Senate no opposition was recorded.</p>

<p>With such influence Jefferson might promise himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
success in any undertaking; and if he had at
heart one object more momentous than the embargo,
it was the punishment of Chief-Justice Marshall for
his treatment of Burr. As early as Nov. 5, 1807,
Senator Tiffin of Ohio began his career in the Senate
by moving, as an amendment to the Constitution,
that all judges of the United States should
hold office for a term of years, and should be removed
by the President on address by two-thirds of both
Houses. Governor Tiffin’s motion was not an isolated
or personal act. The State legislatures were invoked.
Vermont adopted the amendment. The House of
Delegates in Virginia, both branches of the Pennsylvania
legislature, the popular branch in Tennessee,
and various other State governments, in whole or in
part, adopted the principle and urged it upon Congress.
In the House, George W. Campbell moved a
similar amendment January 30, and from time to
time other senators and members made attempts to
bring the subject forward. In the Senate, Giles aided
the attack by bringing in a bill for the punishment
of treason. February 11 he spoke in support of his
proposed measure, advancing doctrines which terrified
Democrats as well as Federalists. Joseph Story was
one of his audience, and wrote an account of this
alarming speech:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Giles exhibits in his appearance no marks of greatness;
he has a dark complexion and retreating eyes,
black hair, and robust form. His dress is remarkably
plain and in the style of Virginia carelessness. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
broken his leg a year or two since, he uses a crutch, and
perhaps this adds somewhat to the indifference or doubt
with which you contemplate him. But when he speaks,
your opinion immediately changes.... I heard him a
day or two since in support of a bill to define treason,
reported by himself. Never did I hear such all-unhinging
and terrible doctrines. He laid the axe at the root of
judicial power, and every stroke might be distinctly felt.
His argument was very specious and forensic, sustained
with many plausible principles and adorned with various
political axioms, designed <i>ad captandum</i>. One of its
objects was to prove the right of the Legislature to <i>define</i>
treason. My dear friend, look at the Constitution
of the United States and see if any such construction
can possibly be allowed!... He attacked Chief-Justice
Marshall with insidious warmth. Among other things
he said, “I have learned that judicial opinions on this
subject are like changeable silks, which vary their colors
as they are held up in political sunshine.””<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Had Giles’s proposed definition of treason become
law, it would in another half-century have had singular
interest for Virginians of his school. According to
this bill any persons, without exception, “owing allegiance
to the United States of America,” who should
assemble with intent forcibly to change the government
of the United States, or to dismember them or
any one of them, or to resist the general execution of
any public law, should suffer death as a traitor; and
even though not personally present at the assemblage
or at the use of force, yet should any person aid or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
assist in doing any of the acts proscribed, such person
should also suffer death as a traitor.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Fortunately
for Southern theories the bill, although it passed the
Senate by means of Southern votes, was lost in the
House, where John Randolph had introduced a bill
of his own more moderate in character.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Although the attack on the Supreme Court was
more persistent and was carried further than ever
before, it met with passive resistance which foreshadowed
failure, and probably for this reason was
allowed to exhaust its strength in the committee-rooms
of Congress. The chief-justice escaped without
a wound. Under the shadow of the embargo he could
watch in security the slow exhaustion of his antagonist.
Jefferson had lost the last chance of reforming
the Supreme Court. In another six months Congress
would follow the will of some new Executive chief;
and if in the full tide of Jefferson’s power Marshall
had repeatedly thwarted or defied him with impunity,
the chance was small that another President would
meet a happier fate.</p>

<p>The failure of his attack on the Supreme Court was
not the only evidence that Jefferson’s authority when
put to the test was more apparent than real. If in
the President’s eyes Marshall deserved punishment,
another offender merited it still more. Senator Smith
of Ohio was deeply implicated in Burr’s conspiracy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
The dignity of the President and of Congress demanded
inquiry, and an investigation was made. The
evidence left no reasonable doubt that Smith had
been privy to Burr’s scheme; but the motion to expel
him from the Senate failed by a vote of nineteen to
ten, two thirds being required for this purpose. In
the House, John Randolph brought charges against
General Wilkinson which could neither be admitted
nor met. The Administration was obliged to cover
and ignore the military scandals brought to light by
Burr’s trial.</p>

<p>Even in regard to more serious matters the Government
could hardly feel secure. In February, Sloan
of New Jersey offered a motion that the seat of
government should be removed from Washington to
Philadelphia. The House, February 2, by a vote of
sixty-eight to forty-seven, agreed to consider the resolution,
and a debate followed which proved how far
from stable the actual arrangement was supposed to
be. Republicans and Federalists alike assailed the
place in which they were condemned to live. Fifteen
million dollars, it was said, had been spent upon it with
no other result than to prove that a city could never
be made to exist there. One day they were choked
with dust; the next they were wallowing in mire.
The climate was one of violent changes and piercing
winds. Members sickened and died in greater numbers
than ever before, but in case of illness they could
find no physician except by sending to the navy yard
some miles away. At the last session the House had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
been driven from its old hall by the wind breaking
its windows. The new hall, however magnificent
was unfit for its purpose; to hear was impossible; its
ventilation was so bad as to have caused the illness
of Jacob Crowninshield, one of its leading members,
then lying at the point of death. The prices of everything
in Washington were excessive. Butter was
fifty cents a pound; a common turkey cost a dollar
and a half; in Philadelphia members would save one
hundred and fifty dollars a day in hack-hire alone.
Even these objections were trifling compared with
the inconvenience of governing from a wilderness
where no machinery existed to make administration
easy. As an example of the absurdities of such a
system, members pointed to the navy yard, only to
be reached by following the windings of the shallow
Potomac, while the Navy Department was
obliged at extravagant cost to bring every article
of use from the seaboard, besides recruiting seamen
at the commercial ports for every ship fitted out at
Washington.</p>

<p>Sloan desisted from his motion only after the House
had shown itself strongly inclined toward his opinion.
On another point the divergence of ideas became more
marked, and Jefferson found himself obliged to strain
his influence.</p>

<p>In the Republican party any vote for a standing
army had been hitherto considered a crime. The
Federalists in 1801 had left a force of five thousand
men; Jefferson reduced it to three thousand. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Republican party believed in a militia, but neglected
it. Throughout the Southern States the militia was
undisciplined and unarmed; but in Massachusetts,
as President Jefferson was beginning to notice, the
Federalists took much care of their State soldiery.
The United States fort at Newport was garrisoned
only by goats, and the strategic line of Lake Champlain
and the Hudson River, which divided New England
from the rest of the Union, lay open to an
enemy. In view of war with England such negligence
became wanton. Jefferson saw that an army
must be raised; but many of his truest followers held
that militia alone could be trusted, and that the risk
of conquest from abroad was better than the risk of
military despotism at home.</p>

<p>For a people naturally brave, Americans often
showed themselves surprisingly unwilling to depend
upon their own strength. To defy danger, to rush
into competition with every foreign rival, to take risks
without number, and to depend wholly on themselves
were admitted characteristics of Americans as individuals;
but the same man who, when left to his own
resources, delighted in proving his skill and courage,
when brought within the shadow of government never
failed to clamor for protection. As a political body
the American people shrank from tests of its own
capacity. “American systems” of politics, whether
domestic or foreign, were systems for evading competition.
The American system in which the old
Republican party believed was remarkable for avowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
want of self-confidence as the foundation of
domestic as well as of foreign policy. The Republican
party stood alone in refusing, on principle, to
protect national rights from foreign outrage; but it
defied imitation when the sacrifice of national rights
was justified by the argument that if American liberties
were not abandoned to foreign nations they would
be destroyed by the people themselves. War, which
every other nation in history had looked upon as the
first duty of a State, was in America a subject for
dread, not so much because of possible defeat as of
probable success. No truer Republican could be found
in Virginia than John W. Eppes, one of Jefferson’s
sons-in-law; and when the House debated in February
a Senate bill for adding two regiments to the
regular army, Eppes declared the true Republican
doctrine:<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If we have war, this increase of the army will be
useless; if peace, I am opposed to it. I am in favor of
putting arms into the hands of our citizens and then let
them defend themselves.... If we depend on regular
troops alone, the liberty of the country must finally be
destroyed by that army which is raised to defend it. Is
there an instance in which a nation has lost its liberty
by its own citizens in time of peace? It is by standing
armies and very often by men raised on an emergency
and professing virtuous feelings, but who eventually
turned their arms against their country.... I never
yet have voted for a regular army or soldier in time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of peace. Whenever an opportunity has offered I have
voted them down; and so help me God! I will as long
as I live.”</p>
</div>

<p>One week after Eppes spoke these words, President
Jefferson sent to Congress a Message asking for an
immediate addition of six thousand men to the
regular army.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> No such blow had ever been given
to the established practices of Republican administration.
Ten years before, every leader of the
party had denounced the raising of twelve regiments
at a time of actual hostilities with France, although
the law limited their service to the term of the expected
war. The eight regiments demanded by Jefferson
were to be raised for five years in a time
of peace. The Southern Republicans saw themselves
required to walk, publicly and avowedly, in the footsteps
of their monarchical predecessors; while John
Randolph stood by and jeered at them.</p>

<p>The House waited until Rose had fairly sailed and
the session drew near its end, with embargo fastened
upon the country, and no alternative visible but war;
then slowly and unwillingly began its recantations.
April 4 John Clopton of Virginia<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> admitted that in
1798 he had voted against the army. His excuse for
changing his vote was that in 1798 he thought there
was no ground for fearing war, while in 1808 he
saw little ground for hoping peace. Yet he voted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
for the new regiments only because they were so
few; and even in the event of actual war “he could
scarcely imagine that he could be induced to admit
the expediency of increasing the regular forces to a
number much greater than they would be” under
the present bill. Clopton was answered by Randolph,
who warmly opposed the new army for the same
reasons which had led him to oppose the old one.
Randolph was followed by George M. Troup of
Georgia,—a young man not then so prominent as
he was destined to become, who declared that no one
had more confidence than he felt in militia; but
“it is well known that the present defective system
of militia in our quarter of the country at least is
good for nothing;” and a small standing army was
not dangerous but necessary, because it would preserve
peace by preparing for war.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Smilie of Pennsylvania
added another reason. He argued that John
Randolph had favored raising troops in the year
1805 to protect the Southern frontier “from Spanish
inroad and insult.” Smilie had then opposed the
motion and the House had rejected it, but to Smilie
the argument that Randolph had once favored an
increase of the army, seemed decisive.</p>

<p>A much respected member from South Carolina—David
R. Williams, one of Randolph’s friends—then
took the floor.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He could not bring himself to vote
for the bill, because no half-way measure would answer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
War would require not six but sixty thousand
men; defensive armies were worse than none, either
in war or peace. Williams’s argument was so evidently
weak that it failed to convince even Macon,
who had voted against the twelve regiments in 1798,
but meant to change his ground and believed himself
able to prove his consistency. In contradiction
to the bill itself he maintained that the new army
was not a peace establishment; that if it were so he
would not vote for it. He condemned the maxim
that to preserve peace nations must be prepared for
war, and asserted that no analogy existed between
1798 and 1808, for that in 1808 America was attacked
by foreign powers, while in 1798 she attacked
them.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Discordant as these voices were, the debate was the
next day enlivened by a discord more entertaining.
Richard Stanford of North Carolina, one of the oldest
members of the House, a close ally of Randolph,
Macon, and Williams, made a speech which troubled
the whole body of Southern Republicans.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Stanford
voted for the twelve regiments in 1798, but like the
majority of Republicans he did so in deference to a
party caucus, in order to ward off the danger of a
larger force. He said it was the only Federalist
vote he ever gave, and he promised his friends never
again to be caught in the same mistake. With candor
intended to irritate, he arrayed the occasions on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
which his party had refused to increase the military
establishment: first, in a state of actual hostilities in
1798; again, when Spain defied and insulted the
government in 1805; still again, on the brink of a
Spanish war during Burr’s conspiracy in 1806. He
quoted Jefferson’s first Inaugural Address, which
counted among the essential principles of the government
“a well-disciplined militia, our best reliance
in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars
may relieve them;” and the Annual Message of 1806,
which said, “Were armies to be raised whenever a
speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never
should have been without them; our resources would
have been exhausted on dangers which have never
happened, instead of being reserved for what is
really to take place.” He quoted also pungent resolutions
of 1798, speeches of Eppes and Wilson Cary
Nicholas, of Varnum and Gallatin; he showed the
amount of patronage once abolished but restored
by this bill; and when at last he sat down, the
Southern members were ruffled until even Macon lost
his temper.</p>

<p>Soon John Randolph rose again, and if Stanford’s
speech was exasperating in its candor, Randolph’s
was stinging in its sarcasm.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> He treated the new
defensive system with ridicule. The Navy Department,
he said, had dwindled to a Gunboat Department.
Congress built gunboats to protect shipping
and coasts, and built forts to protect gunboats. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
army was equally feeble; and both were at odds with
the embargo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When the great American tortoise draws in his head
you do not see him trotting along; he lies motionless on
the ground; it is when the fire is put on his back that he
makes the best of his way, and not till then. The system
of embargo is one system, withdrawing from every contest,
quitting the arena, flying the pit. The system of
raising troops and fleets of whatever sort is another and
opposite to that dormant state.... They are at war
with each other, and cannot go on together.”</p>
</div>

<p>Even if not inconsistent with the embargo, the
army was still useless:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My worthy friend from Georgia has said that the
tigress, prowling for food for her young, may steal upon
you in the night. I would as soon attempt to fence a
tiger out of my plantation with a four-railed fence as to
fence out the British navy with this force.”</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph ventured even to ridicule the State of
Virginia which was said to demand an army:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My friend and worthy colleague tells us that the
State of Virginia, so much opposed to armies, has now
got to the war pitch so far as to want one regiment
for the defence of half a million of souls and seventy
thousand square miles.... Yes, sir; the legislature of
Virginia, my parent State, of whom I cannot speak with
disrespect, nor will I suffer any man worth my resentment
to speak of her with disrespect in my hearing, has
been earned away by the military mania, and they want
one regiment!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Yet Randolph approved the embargo as little as he
liked the army and navy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not one of those who approve the embargo,”
he said in another speech.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> “It gives up to Great
Britain all the seamen and all the commerce,—their feet
are not now upon your decks, for your vessels are all
riding safely moored along your slips and wharves; and
this measure absolutely gives Agriculture a blow which
she cannot recover till the embargo is removed. What
has become of your fisheries? Some gentleman has introduced
a proposition for buying their fish to relieve the
fishermen. Indeed, I would much sooner assent to buying
their fish than to raising these troops, except indeed
we are raising the troops to eat the fish.”</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph broke into shrill laughter at his own
joke, delighted with the idea of six thousand armed
men paid to eat the fish that were rotting on the
wharves at Gloucester and Marblehead.</p>

<p>Keenly as Randolph enjoyed the pleasure of ridiculing
his colleagues and friends, he could expect to
gain no votes. George W. Campbell and the other
Administration speakers admitted that the embargo
might yield to war and that an army had become
necessary. Even Eppes had the courage to defy ridicule,
and in full recollection of having vowed to God
February 17 that as long as he lived he would vote
down a regular army, he rose April 7 to support the
bill for raising eight regiments:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I consider it as part of the system designed to
meet the present crisis in our affairs.... The period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
must arrive when the embargo will be a greater evil
than war. When that period shall arrive it will be
taken off.”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the same day the bill passed by a vote of ninety-five
to sixteen, and the Republican party found itself
poorer by the loss of one more traditional principle.
Events were hurrying the Government toward dangers
which the party had believed to be preventable under
the system invented by Virginia and Pennsylvania.
In 1804 Jefferson wrote to Madison: “It is impossible
that France and England should combine to any
purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The impossible had happened, and every
practice founded on the theory of mutual jealousy
between European Powers became once more a subject
of dispute. On the day of Rose’s departure
Jefferson, abandoning the secrecy in which until that
moment he had wrapped his diplomacy, sent to Congress
a mass of diplomatic correspondence with England
and France, running back to the year 1804. A
few days later, March 30, he sent a secret message
accompanied by documents which gave to Congress,
with little exception, everything of importance that
had passed between the governments. Only one subject
was kept back:—the tenebrous negotiation for
Florida remained secret.</p>

<p>From these documents Congress could see that the
time for talking of theories of peace and friendship
or of ordinary commercial interests had passed. Violence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
and rapine marked every page of the latest
correspondence. February 23 Erskine had at last
notified the Government officially of the existence and
purpose of the Orders in Council. His note repeated
the words of Canning’s instructions.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> After asserting
that America had submitted to the French Decrees,
and had thereby warranted England in forbidding if
she pleased all American commerce with France,
Erskine pointed out that the Orders in Council, by
not prohibiting but limiting this commerce, gave proof
of his Majesty’s amicable disposition. The Americans
might still transport French and Spanish colonial
produce to England, and re-export it to the continent
of Europe under certain regulations:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The object of these regulations will be the establishment
of such a protecting duty as shall prevent the
enemy from obtaining the produce of his own colonies
at a cheaper rate than that of the colonies of Great
Britain. In this duty it is evident that America is
no otherwise concerned than as being to make an
advance to that amount, for which it is in her power
amply to indemnify herself at the expense of the foreign
consumer.”</p>
</div>

<p>Further, the orders licensed the importation through
England into France of all strictly American produce,
except cotton, without paying duty in transit:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The reason why his Majesty could not feel himself
at liberty, consistent with what was necessary for the
execution of his purpose in any tolerable degree, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
allow this relaxation to apply to cotton is to be found
in the great extent to which France has pushed the
manufacture of that article, and the consequent embarrassment
upon her trade which a heavy import upon cotton
as it passes through Great Britain to France must
necessarily produce.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine’s note claimed credit for England because
the orders were not abruptly enforced, but allowed
time for neutrals to understand and conform to them.
The concluding sentences were intended to soothe the
suffering merchants:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The right of his Majesty to resort to retaliation cannot
be questioned. The suffering occasioned to neutral
parties is incidental, and not of his Majesty’s seeking.
In the exercise of this undoubted right, his Majesty has
studiously endeavored to avoid aggravating unnecessarily
the inconveniences suffered by the neutral; and I am
commanded by his Majesty especially to represent to
the Government of the United States the earnest desire
of his Majesty to see the commerce of the world restored
once more to that freedom which is necessary
for its prosperity; and his readiness to abandon the
system which has been forced upon him whenever the
enemy shall retract the principles which have rendered it
necessary.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this note—a model of smooth-spoken outrage—Congress
could understand that until the
King of England should make other regulations
American commerce was to be treated as subject
to the will and interest of Great Britain. At the
same moment Congress was obliged to read a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
letter from Champagny to Armstrong, dated Jan.
15, 1808, in defence of the Berlin and Milan Decrees.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
Written in words dictated by Napoleon,
this letter asserted rude truths which irritated
Americans the more because they could not be
denied:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The United States, more than any other Power, have
to complain of the aggressions of England. It has not
been enough for her to offend against the independence
of their flag,—nay, against that of their territory and of
their inhabitants,—by attacking them even in their ports,
by forcibly carrying away their crews; her decrees of the
11th November have made a fresh attack on their commerce
and on their navigation as they have done on those
of all other Powers.</p>

<p>“In the situation in which England has placed the
Continent, especially since her decrees of the 11th November,
his Majesty has no doubt of a declaration of
war against her by the United States. Whatever transient
sacrifices war may occasion, they will not believe it
consistent either with their interest or dignity to acknowledge
the monstrous principle and the anarchy which that
government wishes to establish on the seas. If it be
useful and honorable for all nations to cause the true
maritime law of nations to be re-established, and to
avenge the insults committed by England against every
flag, it is indispensable for the United States, who from
the extent of their commerce have oftener to complain
of those violations. War exists then in fact between
England and the United States; and his Majesty considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
it as declared from the day on which England
published her decrees.”</p>
</div>

<p>Two such letters could hardly have been written to
the chief of an independent people and submitted
to a free legislature in Europe without producing a
convulsion. Patient as Congress was, the temper excited
by Champagny’s letter obliged the President,
April 2, to withdraw the injunction of secrecy after
the House had twice rejected a motion to do so without
his permission; but the motive of the Federalists
in publishing Champagny’s letter was not so much to
resent it as to divert popular anger from England to
France. No outburst of national self-respect followed
the appearance of the two letters. During the next
week the House debated and passed the bill for raising
the army to ten thousand men, but on all sides
the friends and opponents of the measure equally
deprecated war. The report of a special committee
in the Senate, April 16, expressed on that point the
general feeling of Congress:<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“With respect to a resort to war as a remedy for the
evils experienced, the committee will offer no other reflection
than that it is in itself so great an evil that the
United States have wisely considered peace and honest
neutrality as the best foundation of their general policy.
It is not for the committee to say under what degree of
aggravated injuries and sufferings a departure from this
policy may become a duty, and the most pacific nation
find itself compelled to exchange for the calamities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
war the greater distresses of longer forbearance. In the
present state of things the committee cannot recommend
any departure from that policy which withholds our commercial
and agricultural property from the licensed depredations
of the great maritime belligerent Powers. They
hope that an adherence to this policy will eventually
secure to us the blessings of peace without any sacrifice
of our national rights; and they have no doubt that it
will be supported by all the manly virtue which the good
people of the United States have ever discovered on
great and patriotic occasions.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Senate passed a bill authorizing the President
during the recess to suspend the embargo in whole
or in part if in his judgment the conduct of the
belligerent Powers should render suspension safe.
After a hot debate, chiefly on the constitutionality
of the measure, it passed the House, and April 22
became law. April 25 the session ended.</p>

<p>As the result of six months’ labor, Congress could
show besides the usual routine legislation a number
of Acts which made an epoch in the history of the
Republican party. First came the Embargo, its two
Supplements, and the Act empowering the President
to suspend it at will. Next came the series of appropriation
Acts which authorized the President to spend
in all four million dollars in excess of the ordinary
expenditures,—for gunboats, eight hundred and fifty
thousand dollars; for land fortifications, one million;
for five new regiments of infantry, one of riflemen,
one of light artillery, and one of light dragoons, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
million dollars; and two hundred thousand dollars
for arming the militia. Such progress toward energy
was more rapid than could have been expected from
a party like that which Jefferson had educated and
which he still controlled.</p>

</div>


<p>“This six months’ session has worn me down to a
state of almost total incapacity for business,” wrote
President Jefferson to his attorney-general.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> “Congress
will certainly rise to-morrow night, and I shall
leave this for Monticello on the 5th of May, to be
here again on the 8th of June.” More earnestly than
ever he longed for repose and good-will. “For myself,”
he said,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> “I have nothing further to ask of the
world than to preserve in retirement so much of their
esteem as I may have fairly earned, and to be permitted
to pass in tranquillity, in the bosom of my family
and friends, the days which yet remain to me.” He
could not reasonably ask from the world more than
he had already received from it; but a whole year
remained, during which he must still meet whatever
demand the world should make upon him. He had
brought the country to a situation where war was
impossible for want of weapons, and peace was only
a name for passive war. He was bound to carry the
government through the dangers he had braved; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
for the first time in seven years American democracy,
struck with sudden fear of failure, looked to him in
doubt, and trembled for its hopes.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Jefferson’s ease, no serious opposition
was made in the Republican party to his choice
of a successor. Giles and Nicholas, who managed
Madison’s canvass in Virginia, caused a caucus to be
held, January 21, at Richmond, where one hundred
and twenty-three members of the State legislature
joined in nominating electors for Madison. Randolph’s
friends held another caucus, at which fifty-seven
members of the same legislature joined in
nominating electors for Monroe. To support the
Virginia movement for Madison, a simultaneous
caucus was held at Washington, where, January 20,
Senator Bradley of Vermont issued a printed circular
inviting the Republican members of both Houses
to consult, January 23, respecting the next Presidential
election. Bradley’s authority was disputed
by Monroe’s partisans, and only Madison’s friends,
or indifferent persons, obeyed the call. Eighty-nine
senators and members attended; and on balloting,
eighty-three votes were given for Madison as President,
seventy-nine for George Clinton as Vice-President;
but the names of the persons present were
never published, and the caucus itself seemed afraid
of its own action. About sixty Republican members
or senators held aloof. John Randolph and sixteen
of his friends published a protest against the caucus
and its candidate:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We ask for energy, and we are told of his moderation.
We ask for talents, and the reply is his unassuming
merit. We ask what were his services in the
cause of public liberty, and we are directed to the
pages of the ‘Federalist,’ written in conjunction with
Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, in which the most
extravagant of their doctrines are maintained and propagated.
We ask for consistency as a Republican, standing
forth to stem the torrent of oppression which once
threatened to overwhelm the liberties of the country.
We ask for that high and honorable sense of duty which
would at all times turn with loathing and abhorrence
from any compromise with fraud and speculation. We
ask in vain.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Jefferson had commanded the warm and undisputed
regard of his followers; Madison held no such pre-eminence.
“Every able diplomatist is not fit to be
President,” said Macon. George Clinton, who had
yielded unwillingly to Jefferson, held Madison in
contempt. While Monroe set up a Virginia candidacy
which the Republicans of Randolph’s school
supported, George Clinton set up a candidacy of
his own, in New York, supported by Cheetham’s
“Watch-Tower,” and by a portion of the country
press. Before long, the public was treated to a curious
spectacle. The regular party candidate for the
Vice-presidency became the open rival of the regular
candidate for the Presidency. Clinton’s newspapers
attacked Madison without mercy, while Madison’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
friends were electing Clinton as Madison’s Vice-president.</p>

<p>In this state of things successful opposition to
Madison depended upon the union of his enemies
in support of a common candidate. Not only must
either Monroe or Clinton retire, but one must be
able to transfer his votes to the other; and the whole
Federalist party must be induced to accept the choice
thus made. The Federalists were not unwilling; but
while they waited for the politicians of Virginia and
New York to arrange the plan of campaign, they
busied themselves with recovering control of New
England, where they had been partially driven from
power. The embargo offered them almost a certainty
of success.</p>

<p>From the first moment of the embargo, even during
the secret debate of Dec. 19, 1807, its opponents
raised the cry of French influence; and so positively
and persistently was Jefferson charged with subservience
to Napoleon, that while a single Federalist lived,
this doctrine continued to be an article of his creed.
In truth, Jefferson had never stood on worse terms
with France than when he imposed the embargo. He
acted in good faith when he enclosed Armstrong’s
letter and Regnier’s decision in his Embargo Message.
Turreau was annoyed at his conduct, thinking
it intended to divert public anger from England to
France in order to make easier the negotiation with
Rose. Instead of dictating Jefferson’s course, as the
Federalists believed, Turreau was vexed and alarmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
by it. He complained of Armstrong, Madison, and
Jefferson himself. The Embargo Message, he said,
exposed the Administration in flank to the Federalists,
and gave the English envoy free play. “For me
it was a useless proof—one proof the more—of the
usual awkwardness of the Washington Cabinet, and
of its falsity (<i>fausseté</i>) in regard to France.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> His
contempt involved equally people, Legislature, and
Executive:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Faithful organs of the perverse intentions of the
American people, its representatives came together before
their usual time, in accordance with the President’s
views, and in their private conversation and in their public
deliberations seemed entirely to forget the offences of
England, or rather to have been never affected by them.
This temper, common to the men of all parties, proved
very evidently what was the state of popular opinion in
regard to Great Britain, against whom no hostile project
will ever enter into an American’s thoughts. The Annual
Message was not calculated to inspire energy into
the honorable Congress. All these political documents
from the President’s pen are cold and colorless.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The result of Rose’s negotiation confirmed Turreau’s
disgust:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It can be no longer doubtful that the United States,
whatever insults they may have to endure, will never
make war on Great Britain unless she attacks them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
Every day I have been, and still am, met with the objection
that the decrees of the French government have
changed the disposition of the members of the Executive,
and especially of members of Congress. Both have
seized this incident as a pretext to color their cowardice
(<i>lâcheté</i>), and extend it over their system of inaction;
since it is evident that however severe the measures of
the French government may have been, they weigh light
in the balance when set in opposition to all the excesses,
all the outrages, that England has permitted herself to
inflict on the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
</div>

<p>During the winter and spring nothing occurred to
soothe Turreau’s feelings. On the contrary, his irritation
was increased by the President’s communication
to Congress of Champagny’s letter of January
15, and by the “inconceivable weakness” which
made this letter public:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although I could hardly have calculated on this
new shock, which has considerably weakened our political
credit in the United States, I well knew that we had
lost greatly in the opinion of the Cabinet at Washington
and of its chief. After Mr. Rose’s departure,—that is to
say, about three weeks before the end of the session,—I
quitted the city for reasons of health, which were only
too well founded. I had seen Mr. Jefferson only a week
before I went to take leave of him. Perhaps I should tell
your Excellency that I commonly see the President once
a week, and always in the evening,—a time when I am
sure of finding him at home, and nearly always alone. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
never open upon the chapter of politics, because it seems
more proper for me to wait for him to begin this subject,
and I never wait long. At the interview before the last
I found him extremely cool in regard to the interests of
Europe and the measures of the Powers coalesced against
England. At the last interview he asked me if I had recent
news from Europe. I told him—what was true—that
I had nothing official since two months. ‘You treat
us badly,’ he replied. ‘The governments of Europe do not
understand this government here. Even England, whose
institutions have most analogy with ours, does not know
the character of the American people and the spirit of its
Administration,’ etc. I answered that Great Britain having
violated the law of nations in regard to every people
in succession, the nature and the difference of their institutions
mattered little to a Power which had abjured all
principles. He interrupted me to say: ‘When severe
measures become necessary we shall know how to take
them, but we do not want to be dragged into them (<i>y être
entrainés</i>).’ Although this was directly to the address
of the minister of France, I thought best to avoid a
retort, and contented myself with observing that generally
France gave the example of respect for governments
which sustained their dignity, and that the object of the
coalition of all the European States against England was
to constrain that Power to imitate her. The rest of the
conversation was too vague and too insignificant to be
worth remembering. Nevertheless, Mr. Jefferson repeated
to me what he tells me at nearly every interview,—that
he has much love for France.”</p>
</div>

<p>Turreau drew the inference “that the federal government
intends to-day more than ever to hold an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
equal balance between France and England.” Erskine
saw matters in the same light. Neither the
Frenchman nor the Englishman, although most directly
interested in the bias of President Jefferson,
reported any word or act of his which showed a
wish to serve Napoleon’s ends.</p>

<p>The interests of the Federalists required them to
assert the subservience of Jefferson to France. They
did so in the most positive language, without proof,
and without attempting to obtain proof. Had this
been all, they would have done no worse than their
opponents had done before them; but they also used
the pretext of Jefferson’s devotion to France in
order to cover and justify their own devotion to
England.</p>

<p>After the failure of Rose, in the month of February,
to obtain further concessions from Madison, the
British envoy cultivated more closely the friendship
of Senator Pickering, and even followed his advice.
As early as March 4 he wrote to his Government on
the subject,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is apprehended, should this Government be desirous
that hostilities should take place with England, it
will not venture to commence them, but will endeavor to
provoke her to strike the first blow. In such a case it
would no doubt adopt highly irritating measures. On
this head I beg leave, but with great diffidence, to submit
the views which I have formed here, and which I find
coincide completely with those of the best and most enlightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
men of this country, and who consider her
interests as completely identified with those of Great
Britain. I conceive it to be of extreme importance in
the present state of the public mind in this nation, and
especially as operated upon by the embargo, such as I
have endeavored to represent it in preceding despatches,
to avoid if possible actual warfare,—should it be practicable
consistently with the national honor, to do no more
than retort upon America any measures of insolence and
injury falling short of it which she may adopt. Such a
line of conduct would, I am persuaded, render completely
null the endeavors exerted to impress upon the public
mind here the persuasion of the inveterate rancor with
which Great Britain seeks the destruction of America,
and would turn their whole animosity,—goaded on, as
they would be, by the insults and injuries offered by
France, and the self-inflicted annihilation of their own
commerce,—against their own Government, and produce
an entire change in the politics of the country. A war
with Great Britain would, I have no doubt, prove ultimately
fatal to this Government; but it is to be feared
that the people would necessarily rally round it at the
first moment and at the instant of danger; and an exasperation
would be produced which it might be found impossible
to eradicate for a series of years. Their soundest
statesmen express to me the utmost anxiety that their
fellow-citizens should be allowed to bear the whole burden
of their own follies, and suffer by evils originating
with themselves; and they are convinced that the effects
of punishment inflicted by their own hands must ere long
bring them into co-operation with Great Britain, whilst if
inflicted by hers, it must turn them perhaps irrevocably
against her.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“The best and most enlightened men of the country,”—who
“considered her interests as completely
identified with those of Great Britain,” and who thus
concerted with Canning a policy intended to bring
themselves into power as agents of Spencer Perceval
and Lord Castlereagh,—were Senator Pickering
and his friends. To effect this coalition with the
British ministry Pickering exerted himself to the
utmost. Not only by word of mouth, but also by
letter, he plied the British envoy with argument and
evidence. Although Rose, March 4, wrote to Canning
in the very words of the Massachusetts senator,
March 13 the senator wrote to Rose repeating his
opinion:<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You know my solicitude to have peace preserved
between the two nations, and I have therefore taken the
liberty to express to you my opinion of the true point of
policy to be observed by your Government toward the
United States, in case your mission prove unsuccessful;
that is, to let us alone; to bear patiently the wrongs we
do ourselves. In one word, amidst the irritations engendered
by hatred and folly, to maintain a dignified composure,
and to abstain from war,—relying on this, that
whatever disposition exists to provoke, there is none to
commence a war on the part of the United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>To support his views Pickering enclosed a letter
from Rufus King. “I also know,” he continued,
“that in the present unexampled state of the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
our own best citizens consider the interests of the
United States to be interwoven with those of Great
Britain, and that our safety depends on hers....
Of the opinions and reasonings of such men I wish
you to be possessed.” He held out a confident hope
that the embargo would end in an overthrow of the
Administration, and that a change in the head of
the government would alter its policy “in a manner
propitious to the continuance of peace.” A few days
afterward he placed in Rose’s hands two letters from
George Cabot. Finally, on the eve of Rose’s departure,
March 22, he gave the British envoy a letter to
Samuel Williams of London. “Let him, if you please,
be the medium of whatever epistolary intercourse may
take place between you and me.”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>To these advances Rose replied in his usual tone of
courteous superiority:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I avail myself thankfully of your permission to keep
that gentleman’s [Rufus King’s] letter, which I am sure
will carry high authority where I can use it confidentially,
and whither it is most important that what I conceive to
be right impressions should be conveyed. It is not to
you that I need protest that rancorous impressions of
jealousy or ill-will have never existed there; but it is to
be feared that at some time or another the extremest
point of human forbearance may be reached. Yet at
the present moment there is, I think, a peculiarity of
circumstances most strange indeed, which enables the
offended party to leave his antagonist to his own suicidal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
devices, unless, in his contortions under them, he
may strike some blow which the other might not be able
to dissemble.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>
</div>

<p>No senator of the United States could submit,
without some overpowering motive, to such patronage.
That Pickering should have invited it was the
more startling because he knew better than any other
man in America the criminality of his act. Ten
years before, at a time when Pickering was himself
Secretary of State, the Pennsylvania Quaker, Dr.
Logan, attempted, with honest motives, to act as an
amateur negotiator between the United States government
and that of France. In order to prevent
such mischievous follies for the future, Congress,
under the inspiration of Pickering, passed a law
known as “Logan’s Act,” which still stood on the
statute book:<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every citizen of the United States, whether actually
resident or abiding within the same, or in any foreign
country, who, without the permission or authority of the
government, directly or indirectly commences or carries
on any verbal or written correspondence or intercourse
with any foreign government, or any officer or agent
thereof, with an intent to influence the measures or conduct
of any foreign government, or of any officer or
agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies
with the United States, or to defeat the measures of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
the government of the United States; and every person
... who counsels, advises, or assists in any such correspondence,
with such intent, shall be punished by a
fine of not more than five thousand dollars, and by imprisonment
during not less than six months, nor more
than three years.”</p>
</div>

<p>When Pickering defied fine and imprisonment
under his own law, in order to make a concert of
political action with George Canning to keep the
British government steady in aggression, he believed
that his end justified his means; and he avowed his
end to be the bringing of his friends into power.
For this purpose he offered himself to Canning as
the instrument for organizing what was in fact a
British party in New England, asking in return only
the persistence of Great Britain in a line of policy
already adopted, which was sure to work against the
Republican rule. Pickering knew that his conduct
was illegal; but he had in his hands an excuse which
justified him, as he chose to think, in disregarding
the law. He persuaded himself that Jefferson was
secretly bound by an engagement with Napoleon to
effect the ruin of England.</p>

<p>Then came Pickering’s master-stroke. The April
election—which would decide the political control
of Massachusetts for the coming year, and the choice
of a senator in the place of J. Q. Adams—was close
at hand. February 16, the day when Rose’s negotiation
broke down, Pickering sent to Governor Sullivan
of Massachusetts a letter intended for official communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
to the State legislature.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> “I may claim some
share of attention and credit,” he began,—“that
share which is due to a man who defies the world
to point, in the whole course of a long and public life,
at one instance of deception, at a single departure
from Truth.” He entered into speculations upon the
causes which had led Congress to impose the embargo.
Omitting mention of the Orders in Council, he showed
that the official reasons presented in the President’s
Embargo Message were not sufficient to justify the
measure, and that some secret motive must lie hidden
from public view:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Has the French Emperor declared that he will have
no neutrals? Has he required that our ports, like those
of his vassal States in Europe, be shut against British
commerce? Is the embargo a substitute, a milder form
of compliance, with that harsh demand, which if exhibited
in its naked and insulting aspect the American
spirit might yet resent? Are we still to be kept profoundly
ignorant of the declarations and avowed designs
of the French Emperor, although these may strike at our
liberty and independence? And in the mean time are
we, by a thousand irritations, by cherishing prejudices,
and by exciting fresh resentments, to be drawn gradually
into a war with Great Britain? Why amid the extreme
anxiety of the public mind is it still kept on the rack of
fearful expectation by the President’s portentous silence
respecting his French despatches? In this concealment
there is danger. In this concealment must be wrapt up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
the real cause of the embargo. On any other supposition
it is inexplicable.”</p>
</div>

<p>Never was Jefferson’s sleight-of-hand more dexterously
turned against him than in this unscrupulous
appeal to his own official language. In all Pickering’s
voluminous writings this letter stood out alone,
stamped by a touch of genius.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“By false policy,” he continued, “or by inordinate
fears, our country may be betrayed and subjugated to
France as surely as by corruption. I trust, sir, that no
one who knows me will charge it to vanity when I say
that I have some knowledge of public men and of public
affairs; and on that knowledge, and with solemnity, I
declare to you that I have no confidence in the wisdom
or correctness of our public measures; that our country
is in imminent danger; that it is essential to the public
safety that the blind confidence in our rulers should
cease; that the State legislatures should know the facts
and the reasons on which important general laws are
founded; and especially that those States whose farms
are on the ocean and whose harvests are gathered in
every sea, should immediately and seriously consider how
to preserve them.”</p>
</div>

<p>To those Federalists leaders who had been acquainted
with the plans of 1804, the meaning of this
allusion to the commercial States could not be doubtful.
Least of all could Pickering’s colleague in the Senate,
who had so strenuously resisted the disunion scheme,
fail to understand the drift of Pickering’s leadership.
John Quincy Adams, at whose growing influence this
letter struck, had been from his earliest recollection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
through his father’s experience or his own, closely
connected with political interests. During forty years
he had been the sport of public turbulence, and for
forty years he was yet to undergo every vicissitude
of political failure and success; but in the range of
his chequered life he was subjected to no other trial
so severe as that which Pickering forced him to meet.
In the path of duty he might doubtless face social and
political ostracism, even in a town such as Boston
then was, and defy it. Men as good as he had done
as much, in many times and places; but to do this
in support of a President whom he disliked and distrusted,
for the sake of a policy in which he had no
faith, was enough to shatter a character of iron.
Fortunately for him, his temper was not one to seek
relief in half-way measures. He had made a mistake
in voting for an embargo without limit of time; but
since no measure of resistance to Europe more vigorous
than the embargo could gain support from either
party, he accepted and defended it. He attended the
Republican caucus January 23, and voted for George
Clinton as President; and when Pickering flung
down his challenge in the letter of February 16,
Adams instantly took it up.</p>

<p>Governor Sullivan naturally declined to convey
Senator Pickering’s letter to the Legislature; but
a copy had been sent to George Cabot, who caused
it, March 9, to be published. The effect was violent.
Passion took the place of reason, and swept the Federalists
into Pickering’s path. Governor Sullivan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
published a vigorous reply, but lost his temper in
doing so, and became abusive where he should have
been cool.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> When Pickering’s letter was received
at Washington, Adams wrote an answer,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> which
reached Boston barely in time to be read before the
election. He went over the history of the embargo;
pointed out its relation to the Orders in Council;
recapitulated the long list of English outrages;
turned fiercely upon the British infatuation of Pickering’s
friends, and called upon them to make their
choice between embargo and war:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If any statesman can point out another alternative
I am ready to hear him, and for any practicable expedient
to lend him every possible assistance. But let not
that expedient be submission to trade under British
licenses and British taxation. We are told that even
under these restrictions we may yet trade to the British
dominions, to Africa and China, and with the colonies
of France, Spain, and Holland. I ask not how much of
this trade would be left when our intercourse with the
whole continent of Europe being cut off would leave us
no means of purchase and no market for sale. I ask
not what trade we could enjoy with the colonies of
nations with which we should be at war. I ask not
how long Britain would leave open to us avenues of
trade which even in these very Orders of Council she
boasts of leaving open as a special indulgence. If we
yield the principle, we abandon all pretence to national
sovereignty.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Thus the issue between a British and American
party was sharply drawn. Governor Sullivan charged
Pickering with an attempt to excite sedition and
rebellion, and to bring about a dissolution of government.
Adams made no mention of his colleague’s
name. In Massachusetts the modern canvass was
unknown; newspapers and pamphlets took the place
of speeches; the pulpit and tavern bar were the only
hustings; and the public opinions of men in high
official or social standing weighed heavily. The letters
of Pickering, Sullivan, and Adams penetrated
every part of the State, and on the issues raised by
them the voters made their choice.</p>

<p>The result showed that Pickering’s calculation on
the embargo was sound. He failed to overthrow
Governor Sullivan, who won his re-election by a
majority of some twelve hundred in a total vote
of about eighty-one thousand; but the Federalists
gained in the new Legislature a decided majority,
which immediately elected James Lloyd to succeed
J. Q. Adams in the Senate, and adopted resolutions
condemning the embargo. Adams instantly resigned
his seat. The Legislature chose Lloyd to complete
the unfinished term.</p>

<p>Thus the great State of Massachusetts fell back
into Federalism. All, and more than all, that Jefferson’s
painful labors had gained, his embargo in a few
weeks wasted. Had the evil stopped there no harm
need have been feared; but the reaction went far
beyond that point. The Federalists of 1801 were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
national party of America; the Federalists of 1808
were a British faction in secret league with George
Canning.</p>

<p>The British government watched closely these
events. Rose’s offensive and defensive alliance with
Timothy Pickering and with the Washington representatives
of the Essex Junto was not the only tie
between Westminster and Boston. Of all British
officials, the one most directly interested in American
politics was Sir James Craig, then Governor of Lower
Canada, who resided at Quebec, and had the strongest
reason to guard against attack from the United
States. In February, 1808, when the question of
peace or war seemed hanging on the fate of Rose’s
mission, Sir James Craig was told by his secretary,
H. W. Ryland, that an Englishman about to visit
New England from Montreal would write back letters
as he went, which might give valuable hints in
regard to the probable conduct of the American
government and people. The man’s name was
John Henry; and in reporting his letters to Lord
Castlereagh as they arrived, Sir James Craig spoke
highly of the writer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Henry is a gentleman of considerable ability,
and, I believe, well able to form a correct judgment on
what he sees passing. He resided for some time in the
United States, and is well acquainted with some of the
leading people of Boston, to which place he was called
very suddenly from Montreal, where he at present lives,
by the intelligence he received that his agent there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
among the sufferers by the recent measures of the American
government. He has not the most distant idea that
I should make this use of his correspondence, which
therefore can certainly have no other view than that
of an unreserved communication with his friend who is
my secretary.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Sir James Craig had something to learn in regard
to volunteer diplomatists of Henry’s type; but being
in no way responsible for the man, he read the letters
which came addressed to Ryland, but which were
evidently meant for the Governor of Canada, and
proved to be worth his reading. The first was written
March 2, from Swanton in Vermont, ten miles
from the Canada border:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will have learned that Congress has passed a
law prohibiting the transport of any American produce
to Canada, and the collector at this frontier post expects
by this day’s mail instructions to carry it into rigorous
execution. The sensibility excited by this measure
among the inhabitants in the northern part of Vermont
is inconceivable. The roads are covered with sleighs,
and the whole country seems employed in conveying
their produce beyond the line of separation. The clamor
against the Government—and this measure particularly—is
such that you may expect to hear of an engagement
between the officers of government and the sovereign
people on the first effort to stop the introduction of that
vast quantity of lumber and produce which is prepared
for the Montreal market.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>
<p>From Windsor in Vermont, March 6, Henry wrote
again, announcing that the best-informed people believed
war to be inevitable between the United States
and England. From Windsor Henry went on to
Boston, where he found himself at home. Acquainted
with the best people, and admitted freely into society,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
he heard all that was said. March 10, when
he had been not more than a day or two in Boston,
he wrote to Ryland, enclosing a Boston newspaper
of the same morning, in which Senator Pickering’s
letter to Governor Sullivan appeared and the
approaching departure of Rose was announced.
Already he professed to be well-advised of what was
passing in private Federalist councils.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The men of talents, property, and influence in Boston
are resolved to adopt without delay every expedient to
avert the impending calamity, and to express their determination
not to be at war with Great Britain in such a
manner as to indicate resistance to the government in the
last resort.... Very active, though secret, measures
are taken to rouse the people from the lethargy which
if long continued must end in their subjection to the
modern Attila.”</p>
</div>

<p>March 18 Henry wrote again, announcing that
the fear of war had vanished, and that Jefferson
meant to depend upon his embargo and a system
of irritation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is, however, to be expected that the evil will produce
its own cure, and that in a few months more of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
suffering and privation of all the benefits of commerce
the people of the New England States will be ready to
withdraw from the confederacy, establish a separate
government, and adopt a policy congenial with their
interests and happiness. For a measure of this sort the
men of talents and property are now ready, and only
wait until the continued distress of the multitude shall
make them acquainted with the source of their misery,
and point out an efficient remedy.”</p>
</div>

<p>These letters, immediately on their receipt at
Quebec, were enclosed by Sir James Craig to Lord
Castlereagh in a letter marked “Private,” dated
April 10, and sent by the Halifax mail, as the
quickest mode of conveyance.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Meanwhile Henry
completed his business in Boston and returned to
Montreal, where he arrived April 11, and three days
afterward wrote again to Ryland at Quebec:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I attended a private meeting of several of the principal
characters in Boston, where the questions of <i>immediate</i>
and <i>ultimate</i> necessity were discussed. In the first, all
agreed that memorials from all the towns (beginning with
Boston) should be immediately transmitted to the Administration,
and a firm determination expressed that they
will not co-operate in a war against England. I distributed
several copies of a memorial to that effect in
some of the towns in Vermont on my return. The measure
of ultimate necessity which I suggested I found in
Boston some unwillingness to consider. It was ‘that
in case of a declaration of war the State of Massachusetts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
should treat separately for itself, and obtain from
Great Britain a guaranty of its integrity.’ Although
it was not deemed necessary to decide on a measure
of this sort at this moment, it was considered as a very
probable step in the last resort. In fine, every man
whose opinion I could ascertain was opposed to a war,
and attached to the cause of England.”</p>
</div>

<p>That Henry reported with reasonable truth the general
character of Federalist conversation was proved
by the nearly simultaneous letters of Pickering to
Rose; but his activity did not stop there. In a final
letter of April 25 he gave a more precise account
of the measures to be taken:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my last I omitted to mention to you that among
the details of the plan for averting from the Northern
States the miseries of French alliance and friendship,
individuals are selected in the several towns on the seaboard
and throughout the country to correspond and act
in concert with the superintending committee at Boston.
The benefits of any organized plan over the distinct and
desultory exertions of individuals are, I think, very
apparent. Whether this confederacy of the men of
talents and property be regarded as a diversion of the
power of the nation, as an efficient means of resistance
to the general government in the event of a war, or the
nucleus of an English party that will soon be formidable
enough to negotiate for the friendship of Great Britain,
it is in all respects very important; and I have well-founded
reason to hope that a few months more of
suffering and the suspension of everything collateral
to commerce will reconcile the multitude to any men and
any system which will promise them relief.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>May 5 the second part of Henry’s correspondence
was forwarded by Sir James Craig to Lord Castlereagh,
who could compare its statements with those
of Pickering, and with the reports of Rose. The
alliance between the New England Federalists and
the British Tories was made. Nothing remained but
to concentrate against Jefferson the forces at their
command.</p>

</div>


<p>The embargo had lasted less than four months,
when April 19 the President at Washington was
obliged to issue a proclamation announcing that on
Lake Champlain and in the adjacent country persons
were combined for the purpose of forming insurrections
against the laws, and that the military power
of the government must aid in quelling such insurrections.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
Immense rafts of lumber were collecting
near the boundary line; and report said that one
such raft, near half a mile long, carried a ball-proof
fort, and was manned by five or six hundred armed
men prepared to defy the custom-house officers. This
raft was said to contain the surplus produce of Vermont
for a year past,—wheat, potash, pork, and beef,—and
to be worth upward of three hundred thousand
dollars.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The governor of Vermont ordered out
a detachment of militia to stop this traffic, and the
governor of New York ordered another detachment
to co-operate with that of Vermont. May 8 rumors
of a battle were afloat, and of forty men killed or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
wounded.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The stories were untrue, but the rafts
escaped, the customs officials not venturing to stop
them.</p>

<p>Reports of this open defiance and insurrection on
the Canada frontier reached Washington at the same
time with other reports which revealed endless annoyances
elsewhere. If the embargo was to coerce
England or France, it must stop supplies to the
West Indian colonies, and prevent the escape of
cotton or corn for the artisans of Europe. The embargo
aimed at driving England to desperation, but
not at famishing America; yet the President found
himself at a loss to do the one without doing the
other. Nearly all commerce between the States was
by coasting-vessels. If the coasting-trade should be
left undisturbed, every schooner that sailed from an
American port was sure to allege that by stress of
weather or by the accidents of navigation it had
been obliged to stop at some port of Nova Scotia or
the West Indies, and there to leave its cargo. Only
the absolute prohibition of the coasting-trade could
prevent these evasions; but to prohibit the coasting-trade
was to sever the Union. The political tie might
remain, but no other connection could survive. Without
the coasting-trade New England would be deprived
of bread, and her industries would perish; Charleston
and New Orleans would stagnate in unapproachable
solitude.</p>

<p>Jefferson proclaimed the existence of an insurrection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
on the Canadian frontier shortly before the
adjournment of Congress. Immediately after the
adjournment he took in hand the more serious difficulties
of the coasting-trade. The experiment of
peaceable coercion was at last to have full trial, and
Jefferson turned to the task with energy that seemed
to his friends excessive, but expressed the vital interest
he felt in the success of a theory on which his
credit as a statesman depended. The crisis was
peculiarly his own; and he assumed the responsibility
for every detail of its management.</p>

<p>May 6 the President wrote to Gallatin a letter containing
general directions to detain in port every
coasting-vessel which could be regarded as suspicious.
His orders were sweeping. The power of the embargo
as a coercive weapon was to be learned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the outset of the business of detentions,” said the
President,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> “I think it impossible to form precise rules.
After a number of cases shall have arisen, they may
probably be thrown into groups and subjected to rules.
The great leading object of the Legislature was, and ours
in execution of it ought to be, to give complete effect to
the embargo laws. They have bidden agriculture, commerce,
navigation to bow before that object,—to be
nothing when in competition with that. Finding all
their endeavors at general rules to be evaded, they
finally gave us the power of detention as the panacea;
and I am clear we ought to use it freely, that we may by
a fair experiment know the power of this great weapon,
the embargo.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>
<p>A few days later Jefferson repeated the warning in
stronger language: “I place immense value in the
experiment being fully made, how far an embargo
may be an effectual weapon in future as well as on
this occasion.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>“Where you are doubtful,” continued the instructions
to Gallatin, “consider me as voting for detention;”
and every coasting-vessel was an object of
doubt. On the same day with the letter of May 6 to
the Secretary of the Treasury, the President wrote a
circular to the governors of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
South Carolina, Georgia, and Orleans,—portions
of the Union which consumed more wheat
than they produced,—requesting them to issue certificates
for such quantities of flour as were likely
to be needed beyond their local supply. The certificates,
directed to the collector of some port usually
exporting flour, were to be issued to “any merchant
in whom you have confidence.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> All other shipments
of produce were objects of suspicion. “I really
think,” wrote the President to Gallatin, “it would
be well to recommend to every collector to consider
every shipment of provisions, lumber, flaxseed, tar,
cotton, tobacco, etc.,—enumerating the articles,—as
sufficiently suspicious for detention and reference
here.” He framed new instructions to the governors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
on this idea: “We find it necessary to consider every
vessel as suspicious which has on board any articles
of domestic produce in demand at foreign markets,
and most especially provisions.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Gallatin, having early declared his want of faith in
the embargo as a coercive measure, was the more
bound to prove that his private opinion did not prevent
him from giving full trial to the experiment
which Executive and Legislature had ordered him to
make. He set himself resolutely to the unpleasant
task. Instead of following the President’s plan of indiscriminate
suspicion and detention, he preferred to
limit the suspicious cargo in value, so that no vessel
could carry provisions to the amount of more than
one-eighth of the bond; but before he could put his
system in force, new annoyances arose. Governor
Sullivan of Massachusetts, under the President’s circular,
issued certificates before July 15 to the amount
of fifty thousand barrels of flour and one hundred
thousand bushels of corn, besides rice and rye. Gallatin
complained to the President,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> who instantly
wrote to the governor of Massachusetts an order to
stop importing provisions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As these supplies, although called for within the
space of two months, will undoubtedly furnish the consumption
of your State for a much longer time, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
thought advisable to ask the favor of your Excellency,
after the receipt of this letter, to discontinue issuing
any other certificates, that we may not unnecessarily
administer facilities to the evasion of the embargo
laws.”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That Massachusetts already on the brink of rebellion
should tolerate such dictation could hardly be
expected; and it was fortunate for Jefferson that
the Federalists had failed to elect a governor of their
own stripe. Even Sullivan, Democrat as he was,
could not obey the President’s request, and excused
his disobedience in a letter which was intended to
convince Jefferson that the people of Massachusetts
were the best judges of the amount of food they
needed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The seaport towns,” Sullivan wrote,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> “are supported
almost entirely by bread from the Southern and Middle
States. The interior of this State live on a mixture of
Indian corn and rye in common regimen, but their fine
bread and pastry depend on the importations from the
southward, carted into the interior. The country towns
consume more imported flour than is equivalent for all
the grain they carry to market in the seaport towns.
Their hogs and poultry consume much Indian corn. The
rice imported here from the southward, since the Embargo
Act, has been very inconsiderable. The Indian
corn is in greater quantities, but that would not find a
market in the British or French dominions if there was
no embargo. This is an article of great demand here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
not as bread, but as sustenance for carriage-horses,
draft-horses, etc., and the quantity consumed is really
astonishing.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sullivan admitted that the habits of the Massachusetts
people, contracted under the royal government
and still continued, led to the evasion of commercial
laws; but he told the President what would be the
result of an arbitrary interference with their supplies
of food:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You may depend upon it that three weeks after
these certificates shall be refused, an artificial and actual
scarcity will involve this State in mobs, riots, and convulsions,
pretendedly on account of the embargo. Your
enemies will have an additional triumph, and your
friends suffer new mortifications.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Governor Sullivan was a man of ability and courage.
Popular and successful, he had broken the long sway
of Federalism in Massachusetts, and within a few
months had carried his re-election against the utmost
exertions of the Essex Junto; but he had seen
John Quincy Adams fall a sacrifice to the embargo,
and he had no wish to be himself the next victim
of Jefferson’s theories. His situation was most difficult,
and he warned the President that the embargo
was making it worse:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The embargo has been popular with what is denominated
the Republican part of the State; but as it does
not appear from anything that has taken place in the
European Powers that it has had the expected effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
there, it has begun to lose its support from the public
opinion.... There are judicious men in this State who
are friends to the present Administration, and who have
been in favor of the embargo as a measure of expedience
which ought to have been adopted by the government,
but who now express great doubts as to the power of
enforcing it much longer under present circumstances.
They do not perceive any of the effects from it that the
nation expected; they do not perceive foreign Powers
influenced by it, as they anticipated. They are convinced,
as they say, that the people of this State must soon be
reduced to suffering and poverty.... These men consider
the embargo as operating very forcibly to the subversion
of the Republican interest here. Should the
measure be much longer continued, and then fail of producing
any important public good, I imagine it will be a
decisive blow against the Republican interest now supported
in this Commonwealth.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Jefferson resented Sullivan’s conduct. A few days
afterward he wrote to General Dearborn, the Secretary
of War, who was then in Maine, warning him to
be ready to support the measure which Sullivan had
declined to adopt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yours of July 27 is received,” Jefferson said.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> “It
confirms the accounts we receive from others that the infractions
of the embargo in Maine and Massachusetts are
open. I have removed Pope, of New Bedford, for worse
than negligence. The collector of Sullivan is on the
totter. The Tories of Boston openly threaten insurrection
if their importation of flour is stopped. The next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
post will stop it. I fear your Governor [Sullivan] is not
up to the tone of these parricides, and I hope on the
first symptom of an open opposition of the law by force
you will fly to the scene, and aid in suppressing any
commotion.”</p>
</div>

<p>Blood was soon shed, but Jefferson did not shrink.
The new army was stationed along the Canada frontier.
The gunboats and frigates patrolled the coast.
On every side dangers and difficulties accumulated.
“I did not expect a crop of so sudden and rank
growth of fraud and open opposition by force could
have grown up in the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> At Newburyport
an armed mob on the wharf prevented the
custom-house officers from detaining a vessel about
to sail. The collectors and other officers were ill-disposed,
or were harassed by suits at law for illegal
detentions. Rebellion and disunion stared Jefferson
in the face, but only caused him to challenge an outbreak
and to invite violence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That the Federalists may attempt insurrection is
possible,” he wrote to Gallatin,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> “and also that the
governor would sink before it; but the Republican part
of the State, and that portion of the Federalists who
approve the embargo in their judgments, and at any rate
would not court mob law, would crush it in embryo. I
have some time ago written to General Dearborn to be
on the alert on such an occasion, and to take direction
of the public authority on the spot. Such an incident
will rally the whole body of Republicans of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
shade to a single point,—that of supporting the public
authority.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Federalists knew when to rebel. Jefferson
could teach them little on that subject. They meant
first to overthrow Jefferson himself, and were in a
fair way to gratify their wish; for the people of New
England—Republican and Federalist alike—were
rapidly rallying to common hatred of the President.
As winter approached, the struggle between Jefferson
and Massachusetts became on both sides vindictive.
He put whole communities under his ban. He stopped
the voyage of every vessel “in which any person is
concerned, either in interest or in navigating her,
who has ever been concerned in interest or in the
navigation of a vessel which has at any time before
entered a foreign port contrary to the views of the
embargo laws, and under any pretended distress or
duress whatever.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> When a permit was asked for
the schooner “Caroline,” of Buckstown on the Penobscot,
Jefferson replied,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is the first time that the character of the place
has been brought under consideration as an objection.
Yet a general disobedience to the laws in any place must
have weight toward refusing to give them any facilities
to evade. In such a case we may fairly require positive
proof that the individual of a town tainted with a general
spirit of disobedience has never said or done anything
himself to countenance that spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>Jefferson went still further in his reply to a petition
from the island of Nantucket for food. “Our
opinion here is that that place has been so deeply
concerned in smuggling, that if it wants it is because
it has illegally sent away what it ought to have retained
for its own consumption.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Of all the old Republican arguments for a policy
of peace, the commonest was that a standing army
would be dangerous, not to foreign enemies, but to
popular liberties; yet the first use of the new army
and gunboats was against fellow-citizens. New England
was chiefly controlled by the navy; but in New
York the army was needed and was employed. Open
insurrection existed there. Besides forcible resistance
offered to the law, no one was ignorant that the
collectors shut their eyes to smuggling, and that
juries, in defiance of court and President, refused
to indict rioters. Governor Tompkins announced
that Oswego was in active insurrection, and called
on the President to issue a proclamation to that
effect.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Jefferson replied by offering to take into
the United States service the militia required to
suppress the riots, and begged Governor Tompkins
to lead his troops in person. “I think it so important
in example to crush these audacious proceedings
and to make the offenders feel the consequences
of individuals daring to oppose a law by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
force, that no effort should be spared to compass
this object.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>When permission was asked to establish a packet
on Lake Champlain, “I do not think this is a time,”
replied Jefferson, “for opening new channels of intercourse
with Canada and multiplying the means of
smuggling.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The people who lived on the shores
of Lake Champlain might object to such interference
in their affairs, but could not deny the force of
Jefferson’s reasoning. Another application of a different
kind was rejected on grounds that seemed
to give to the President general supervision over the
diet of the people:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The declaration of the bakers of New York that their
citizens will be dissatisfied, under the present circumstances
of their country, to eat bread of the flour of their
own State, is equally a libel on the produce and citizens
of the State.... If this prevails, the next application
will be for vessels to go to New York for the pippins of
that State, because they are higher flavored than the same
species of apples growing in other States.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The same sumptuary rule applied to Louisiana.
“You know I have been averse to letting Atlantic
flour go to New Orleans merely that they may have
the <i>whitest</i> bread possible.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>The President seemed alone to feel this passionate
earnestness on behalf of the embargo. His Cabinet
looked on with alarm and disgust. Madison took no
share in the task of enforcement. Robert Smith
sent frigates and gunboats hither and thither, but
made no concealment of his feelings. “Most fervently,”
he wrote to Gallatin, “ought we to pray to
be relieved from the various embarrassments of this
said embargo. Upon it there will in some of the
States, in the course of the next two months, assuredly
be engendered monsters. Would that we
could be placed on proper ground for calling in this
mischief-making busy-body.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Smith talked freely,
while Gallatin, whose opinion was probably the same,
said little, and labored to carry out the law, but
seemed at times disposed to press on the President’s
attention the deformities of his favorite
monster.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am perfectly satisfied,” wrote Gallatin to the President
July 29,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> “that if the embargo must be persisted
in any longer, two principles must necessarily be adopted
in order to make it sufficient: First, that not a single
vessel shall be permitted to move without the special
permission of the Executive; Second, that the collectors
be invested with the general power of seizing property
anywhere, and taking the rudders, or otherwise effectually
preventing the departure of any vessel in harbor,
though ostensibly intended to remain there,—and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
without being liable to personal suits. I am sensible that
such arbitrary powers are equally dangerous and odious;
but a restrictive measure of the nature of the embargo,
applied to a nation under such circumstances as the
United States, cannot be enforced without the assistance
of means as strong as the measure itself. To that legal
authority to prevent, seize, and detain, must be added
a sufficient physical force to carry it into effect; and
although I believe that in our seaports little difficulty
would be encountered, we must have a little army along
the Lakes and British lines generally.... That in the
present situation of the world every effort should be
attempted to preserve the peace of this nation, cannot
be doubted; but if the criminal party-rage of Federalists
and Tories shall have so far succeeded as to defeat our
endeavors to obtain that object by the only measure that
could possibly have effected it, we must submit and prepare
for war.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I mean generally to express an opinion,” continued
the secretary, “founded on the experience of
this summer, that Congress must either invest the
Executive with the most arbitrary powers and sufficient
force to carry the embargo into effect, or give
it up altogether.” That Jefferson should permit a
member of his Cabinet to suggest the assumption of
“the most arbitrary powers;” that he should tolerate
the idea of using means “equally dangerous and
odious,”—seemed incredible; but his reply showed
no sign of offence. He instantly responded,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am satisfied with you that if Orders and Decrees
are not repealed, and a continuance of the embargo is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
preferred to war (which sentiment is universal here),
Congress must legalize all means which may be necessary
to obtain its end.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If repeated and menacing warnings from the people,
the State authorities, and officers of the national
government failed to produce an impression on the
President’s mind, he was little likely to regard what
came from the Judiciary; yet the sharpest of his
irritations was caused by a judge whom he had
himself, in 1804, placed on the Supreme Bench to
counteract Marshall’s influence. Some merchants of
Charleston, with consent of the collector and district-attorney,
applied for a mandamus to oblige the collector
of that town to clear certain ships for
Baltimore. The collector admitted that he believed
the voyage to be intended in good faith, and that
under the Embargo Law he had no right of detention;
but he laid Secretary Gallatin’s instructions
before the court. The case was submitted without
argument, and Justice William Johnson, of the South
Carolina circuit,—a native of South Carolina, and
a warm friend of the President,—decided that the
Act of Congress did not warrant detention, and that
without the sanction of law the collector was not
justified by instructions from the Executive in increasing
the restraints upon commerce. The mandamus
issued.</p>

<p>These proceedings troubled but did not check the
President. “I saw them with great concern,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
wrote to the governor of South Carolina,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> “because
of the quarter from whence they came, and where
they could not be ascribed to any political waywardness.”
Rodney, the attorney-general, undertook to
overrule Justice Johnson’s law, and wrote, under
the President’s instructions, an official opinion that
the court had no power to issue a mandamus in
such a case. This opinion was published in the
newspapers at the end of July, “an act unprecedented
in the history of executive conduct,” which
in a manner forced Justice Johnson into a newspaper
controversy. The Judge’s defence of his course was
temperate and apparently convincing to himself, although
five years afterward he delivered an opinion<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
of the whole Supreme Court in a similar case, “unquestionably
inconsistent” with his embargo decision,
which he then placed on technical ground. He
never regained Jefferson’s confidence; and so effective
was the ban that in the following month of
December the Georgia grand-jury, in his own circuit,
made him the object of a presentment for “improper
interference with the Executive.”</p>

<p>If the conduct of Justice Johnson only stimulated
the President’s exercise of power, the constitutional
arguments of Federalist lawyers and judges were
unlikely to have any better effect; yet to a Virginia
Republican of 1798 no question could have deeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
interest than that of the constitutionality of the embargo.
The subject had already been discussed in
Congress, and had called out a difference of opinion.
There, Randolph argued against the constitutionality
in a speech never reported, which turned on the distinction
between regulating commerce and destroying
it; between a restriction limited in time and
scope, and an interdict absolute and permanent. The
opponents of the embargo system, both Federalists
and Republicans, took the same ground. The Constitution,
they said, empowered Congress “to <i>regulate</i>
commerce with foreign nations, and among the several
States, and with the Indian tribes;” but no one
ever supposed it to grant Congress the power “to
<i>prohibit</i> commerce with foreign nations, and among
the several States, and with the Indian tribes.” Had
such words been employed, the Constitution could
not have gained the vote of a single State.</p>

<p>History has nothing to do with law except to
record the development of legal principles. The
question whether the embargo was or was not Constitutional
depended for an answer on the decision
of Congress, President, and Judiciary, and the assent
of the States. Whatever unanimous decision these political
bodies might make, no matter how extravagant,
was law until it should be reversed. No theory could
control the meaning of the Constitution; but the
relation between facts and theories was a political
matter, and between the embargo and the old Virginia
theory of the Constitution no relation could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
be imagined. Whatever else was doubtful, no one
could doubt that under the doctrine of State-rights
and the rules of strict construction the embargo
was unconstitutional. Only by the widest theories
of liberal construction could its constitutionality be
sustained.</p>

<p>The arguments in its favor were arguments which
had been once regarded as fatal to public liberty.
The first was made by Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky:
“If we have power to lay an embargo for one
day, have we not the power to renew it at the end
of that day? If for sixty days, have we not the
power to renew it again? Would it not amount to
the same thing? If we pass a law to expire within
a limited term, we may renew it at the end of that
term; and there is no difference between a power
to do this, and a power to pass laws without specified
limit.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> This principle, if sound, might be applied
to the right of habeas corpus or of free speech, to
the protection of American manufactures or to the
issue of paper money as a legal tender; and whenever
such application should be made, the Union must
submit to take its chance of the consequences sure
to follow the removal of specified limits to power.
Another argument was used by David R. Williams,
a representative South Carolinian. “The embargo
is not an annihilation but a suspension of commerce,”
he urged,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> “to regain the advantages of which it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
been robbed.” If Congress had the right to regulate
commerce for such a purpose in 1808, South Carolina
seemed to have no excuse for questioning, twenty
years later, the constitutionality of a protective system.
Still another argument was used by George
W. Campbell of Tennessee.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A limited embargo,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> “can only mean an
embargo that is to terminate at some given time; and the
length of time, if a hundred years, will not change the
character of the embargo,—it is still limited. If it be
constitutional to lay it for one day, it must be equally
so to lay it for ten days or a hundred days or as many
years,—it would still be a limited embargo; and no
one will, I presume, deny that an embargo laid for
such a length of time, and one laid without limitation,
would in reality and to all practical purposes be the
same.”</p>
</div>

<p>This reasoning was supported by an immense majority
in both Houses of Congress; was accepted as
sound by the Executive, and roused no protest from
the legislature of any Southern State. So far as
concerned all these high political authorities, the
principle was thus settled that the Constitution,
under the power to regulate commerce, conferred
upon Congress the power to suspend foreign commerce
forever; to suspend or otherwise regulate
domestic and inter-state commerce; to subject all
industry to governmental control, if such interference
in the opinion of Congress was necessary or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
proper for carrying out its purpose; and finally, to
vest in the President discretionary power to execute
or to suspend the system, in whole or in part.</p>

<p>The Judiciary had still to be consulted. In the
September Term, 1808, an embargo case was argued
at Salem before John Davis, judge of the District
Court for Massachusetts; and Samuel Dexter, the
ablest lawyer in New England, urged the constitutional
objections to the embargo with all the force
that ability and conviction could give. No sounder
Federalist than Judge Davis sat on the bench; but
although the newspapers of his party were declaiming
against the constitutionality of the law, and
although Chief-Justice Parsons, of the Massachusetts
Supreme Court, the most eminent legal authority
in the State, lent his private influence on the same
side, Judge Davis calmly laid down the old Federalist
rule of broad construction. His opinion, elaborately
argued and illustrated, was printed in every
newspaper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Stress has been laid in argument,” he said, “on the
word ‘regulate,’ as implying in itself a limitation. Power
to ‘regulate,’ it is said, cannot be understood to give a
power to annihilate. To this it may be replied that the
Acts under consideration, though of very ample extent,
do not operate as a prohibition of all foreign commerce.
It will be admitted that partial prohibitions are authorized
by the expression; and how shall the degree or
extent of the prohibition be adjusted but by the discretion
of the national government, to whom the subject
appears to be committed.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>In the Federalist spirit the Judge invoked the
“necessary and proper” clause, which had been the
cloak for every assumption of doubtful powers; and
then passed to the doctrine of “inherent sovereignty,”
the radical line of division between the
party of President Washington and that of President
Jefferson:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Further, the power to regulate commerce is not to
be confined to the adoption of measures exclusively beneficial
to commerce itself, or tending to its advancement;
but in our national system, as in all modern sovereignties,
it is also to be considered as an instrument for
other purposes of general policy and interest. The
mode of its management is a consideration of great
delicacy and importance; but the national right or power
to adapt regulations of commerce to other purposes
than the mere advancement of commerce appears to me
unquestionable.”</p>
</div>

<p>After drawing these conclusions from the power
to regulate commerce, the Judge went a step further,
and summoned to his aid the spirits which
haunted the dreams of every true Republican,—the
power of war, and necessity of State:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Congress has power to declare war. It of course
has power to prepare for war; and the time, the
manner, and the measure, in the application of constitutional
means, seem to be left to its wisdom and discretion.
Foreign intercourse becomes in such times a
subject of peculiar interest, and its regulation forms an
obvious and essential branch of federal administration....
It seems to have been admitted in the argument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
that State necessity might justify a limited embargo,
or suspension of all foreign commerce; but if Congress
have the power, for purposes of safety, of preparation,
or counteraction, to suspend commercial intercourse with
foreign nations, where do we find them limited as to the
duration more than as to the manner and extent of the
measure?”</p>
</div>

<p>Against this remarkable decision Dexter did not
venture to appeal. Strong as his own convictions
were, he knew the character of Chief-Justice Marshall’s
law too well to hope for success at Washington.
One of Marshall’s earliest constitutional
decisions had deduced from the power of Congress
to pay debts the right for government to assume a
preference over all other creditors in satisfying its
claims on the assets of a bankrupt.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Constructive
power could hardly go further; and the habit of
mind which led to such a conclusion would hardly
shrink from sustaining Judge Davis’s law.</p>

<p>Yet the embargo, in spite of Executive, Legislative,
Judicial, and State authorities, rankled in the
side of the Constitution. Even Joseph Story, though
in after life a convert to Marshall’s doctrines, could
never wholly reconcile himself to the legislation
of 1808.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have ever,” he wrote, “considered the embargo
a measure which went to the utmost limit of constructive
power under the Constitution. It stands upon the extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
verge of the Constitution, being in its very form
and terms an unlimited prohibition or suspension of foreign
commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That President Jefferson should exercise “dangerous
and odious” powers, carrying the extremest
principles of his Federalist predecessors to their
extremest results; that he should in doing so invite
bloodshed, strain his military resources, quarrel
with the State authorities of his own party and
with judges whom he had himself made; that he
should depend for constitutional law on Federalist
judges whose doctrines he had hitherto believed
fatal to liberty,—these were the first fruits of the
embargo. After such an experience, if he or his
party again raised the cry of State-rights, or of
strict construction, the public might, with some
foundation of reason, set such complaints aside as
factious and frivolous, and even, in any other mouth
than that of John Randolph, as treasonable.</p>

<p>The embargo was an experiment in politics well
worth making. In the scheme of President Jefferson’s
statesmanship, non-intercourse was the substitute
for war,—the weapon of defence and coercion
which saved the cost and danger of supporting army
or navy, and spared America the brutalities of the
Old World. Failure of the embargo meant in his
mind not only a recurrence to the practice of war,
but to every political and social evil that war had
always brought in its train. In such a case the
crimes and corruptions of Europe, which had been
the object of his political fears, must, as he believed,
sooner or later teem in the fat soil of America. To
avert a disaster so vast, was a proper motive for
statesmanship, and justified disregard for smaller interests.
Jefferson understood better than his friends
the importance of his experiment; and when in pursuing
his object he trampled upon personal rights
and public principles, he did so, as he avowed in the
Louisiana purchase, because he believed that a higher
public interest required the sacrifice:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My principle is, that the conveniences of our citizens
shall yield reasonably, and their taste greatly, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
the importance of giving the present experiment so fair
a trial that on future occasions our legislators may know
with certainty how far they may count on it as an engine
for national purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Hence came his repeated entreaties for severity,
even to the point of violence and bloodshed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do consider the severe enforcement of the embargo
to be of an importance not to be measured by money,
for our future government as well as present objects.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Everywhere, on all occasions, he proclaimed that
embargo was the alternative to war. The question
next to be decided was brought by this means into
the prominence it deserved. Of the two systems of
statesmanship, which was the most costly,—which
the most efficient?</p>

<p>The dread of war, radical in the Republican theory,
sprang not so much from the supposed waste of life
or resources as from the retroactive effects which war
must exert upon the form of government; but the
experience of a few months showed that the embargo
as a system was rapidly leading to the same effects.
Indeed, the embargo and the Louisiana purchase
taken together were more destructive to the theory
and practice of a Virginia republic than any foreign
war was likely to be. Personal liberties and rights of
property were more directly curtailed in the United
States by embargo than in Great Britain by centuries
of almost continuous foreign war. No one denied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
that a permanent embargo strained the Constitution
to the uttermost tension; and even the Secretary of
the Treasury and the President admitted that it required
the exercise of most arbitrary, odious, and
dangerous powers. From this point of view the
system was quickly seen to have few advantages.
If American liberties must perish, they might as well
be destroyed by war as be stifled by non-intercourse.</p>

<p>While the constitutional cost of the two systems
was not altogether unlike, the economical cost was a
point not easily settled. No one could say what might
be the financial expense of embargo as compared with
war. Yet Jefferson himself in the end admitted that
the embargo had no claim to respect as an economical
measure. The Boston Federalists estimated that the
net American loss of income, exclusive of that on
freights, could not be less than ten per cent for interest
and profit on the whole export of the country,—or
ten million eight hundred thousand dollars on a
total export value of one hundred and eight millions.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
This estimate was extravagant, even if the embargo
had been wholly responsible for cutting off American
trade; it represented in fact the loss resulting to
America from Napoleon’s decrees, the British orders,
and the embargo taken together. Yet at least the
embargo was more destructive than war would have
been to the interests of foreign commerce. Even in
the worst of foreign wars American commerce could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
not be wholly stopped,—some outlet for American
produce must always remain open, some inward bound
ships would always escape the watch of a blockading
squadron. Even in 1814, after two years of war, and
when the coast was stringently blockaded, the American
Treasury collected six million dollars from imports;
but in 1808, after the embargo was in full effect,
the customs yielded only a few thousand dollars
on cargoes that happened to be imported for some
special purpose. The difference was loss, to the disadvantage
of embargo. To this must be added loss
of freight, decay of ships and produce, besides enforced
idleness to a corresponding extent; and finally
the cost of a war if the embargo system should fail.</p>

<p>In other respects the system was still costly. The
citizen was not killed, but he was partially paralyzed.
Government did not waste money or life, but prevented
both money and labor from having their former
value. If long continued, embargo must bankrupt the
government almost as certainly as war; if not long
continued, the immediate shock to industry was more
destructive than war would have been. The expense
of war proved, five years afterward, to be about thirty
million dollars a year, and of this sum much the
larger portion was pure loss; but in 1808, owing to
the condition of Europe, the expense need not have
exceeded twenty millions, and the means at hand
were greater. The effect of the embargo was certainly
no greater than the effect of war in stimulating
domestic industry. In either case the stimulus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
was temporary and ineffective; but the embargo cut
off the resources of credit and capital, while war
gave both an artificial expansion. The result was
that while embargo saved perhaps twenty millions
of dollars a year and some thousands of lives which
war would have consumed, it was still an expensive
system, and in some respects more destructive than
war itself to national wealth.</p>

<p>The economical was less serious than the moral
problem. The strongest objection to war was not its
waste of money or even of life; for money and life
in political economy were worth no more than they
could be made to produce. A worse evil was the lasting
harm caused by war to the morals of mankind,
which no system of economy could calculate. The
reign of brute force and brutal methods corrupted
and debauched society, making it blind to its own
vices and ambitious only for mischief. Yet even on
that ground the embargo had few advantages. The
peaceable coercion which Jefferson tried to substitute
for war was less brutal, but hardly less mischievous,
than the evil it displaced. The embargo opened the
sluice-gates of social corruption. Every citizen was
tempted to evade or defy the laws. At every point
along the coast and frontier the civil, military, and
naval services were brought in contact with corruption;
while every man in private life was placed
under strong motives to corrupt. Every article produced
or consumed in the country became an object
of speculation; every form of industry became a form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of gambling. The rich could alone profit in the end;
while the poor must sacrifice at any loss the little
they could produce.</p>

<p>If war made men brutal, at least it made them
strong; it called out the qualities best fitted to survive
in the struggle for existence. To risk life for
one’s country was no mean act even when done for
selfish motives; and to die that others might more
happily live was the highest act of self-sacrifice to
be reached by man. War, with all its horrors, could
purify as well as debase; it dealt with high motives
and vast interests; taught courage, discipline, and
stern sense of duty. Jefferson must have asked himself
in vain what lessons of heroism or duty were
taught by his system of peaceable coercion, which
turned every citizen into an enemy of the laws,—preaching
the fear of war and of self-sacrifice, making
many smugglers and traitors, but not a single hero.</p>

<p>If the cost of the embargo was extravagant in its
effects on the Constitution, the economy, and the
morals of the nation, its political cost to the party
in power was ruinous. War could have worked no
more violent revolution. The trial was too severe
for human nature to endure. At a moment’s notice,
without avowing his true reasons, President Jefferson
bade foreign commerce to cease. As the order was
carried along the seacoast, every artisan dropped his
tools, every merchant closed his doors, every ship
was dismantled. American produce—wheat, timber,
cotton, tobacco, rice—dropped in value or became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
unsalable; every imported article rose in price;
wages stopped; swarms of debtors became bankrupt;
thousands of sailors hung idle round the
wharves trying to find employment on coasters, and
escape to the West Indies or Nova Scotia. A reign
of idleness began; and the men who were not
already ruined felt that their ruin was only a matter
of time.</p>

<p>The British traveller, Lambert, who visited New
York in 1808, described it as resembling a place
ravaged by pestilence:<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The port indeed was full of shipping, but they were
dismantled and laid up; their decks were cleared, their
hatches fastened down, and scarcely a sailor was to be
found on board. Not a box, bale, cask, barrel, or package
was to be seen upon the wharves. Many of the
counting-houses were shut up, or advertised to be let;
and the few solitary merchants, clerks, porters, and
laborers that were to be seen were walking about with
their hands in their pockets. The coffee-houses were
almost empty; the streets, near the water-side, were almost
deserted; the grass had begun to grow upon the
wharves.”</p>
</div>

<p>In New England, where the struggle of existence
was keenest, the embargo struck like a thunderbolt,
and society for a moment thought itself at an end.
Foreign commerce and shipping were the life of the
people,—the ocean, as Pickering said, was their farm.
The outcry of suffering interests became every day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
more violent, as the public learned that this paralysis
was not a matter of weeks, but of months or years.
New Englanders as a class were a law-abiding people;
but from the earliest moments of their history they
had largely qualified their obedience to the law by
the violence with which they abused and the ingenuity
with which they evaded it. Against the embargo
and Jefferson they concentrated the clamor and
passion of their keen and earnest nature. Rich and
poor, young and old, joined in the chorus; and one
lad, barely in his teens, published what he called
“The Embargo: a Satire,”—a boyish libel on Jefferson,
which the famous poet and Democrat would afterward
have given much to recall:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The belief that Jefferson, sold to France, wished to
destroy American commerce and to strike a deadly
blow at New and Old England at once, maddened
the sensitive temper of the people. Immense losses,
sweeping away their savings and spreading bankruptcy
through every village, gave ample cause for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
their complaints. Yet in truth, New England was
better able to defy the embargo than she was willing
to suppose. She lost nothing except profits which
the belligerents had in any case confiscated; her
timber would not harm for keeping, and her fish were
safe in the ocean. The embargo gave her almost a
monopoly of the American market for domestic
manufactures; no part of the country was so well
situated or so well equipped for smuggling. Above
all, she could easily economize. The New Englander
knew better than any other American how to cut
down his expenses to the uttermost point of parsimony;
and even when he became bankrupt he had
but to begin anew. His energy, shrewdness, and education
were a capital which the embargo could not
destroy, but rather helped to improve.</p>

<p>The growers of wheat and live stock in the Middle
States were more hardly treated. Their wheat, reduced
in value from two dollars to seventy-five cents
a bushel, became practically unsalable. Debarred a
market for their produce at a moment when every
article of common use tended to rise in cost, they
were reduced to the necessity of living on the produce
of their farms; but the task was not then so difficult
as in later times, and the cities still furnished local
markets not to be despised. The manufacturers of
Pennsylvania could not but feel the stimulus of the
new demand; so violent a system of protection was
never applied to them before or since. Probably for
that reason the embargo was not so unpopular in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
Pennsylvania as elsewhere, and Jefferson had nothing
to fear from political revolution in this calm and
plodding community.</p>

<p>The true burden of the embargo fell on the Southern
States, but most severely upon the great State of
Virginia. Slowly decaying, but still half patriarchal,
Virginia society could neither economize nor
liquidate. Tobacco was worthless; but four hundred
thousand negro slaves must be clothed and
fed, great establishments must be kept up, the social
scale of living could not be reduced, and even
bankruptcy could not clear a large landed estate without
creating new encumbrances in a country where
land and negroes were the only forms of property on
which money could be raised. Stay-laws were tried,
but served only to prolong the agony. With astonishing
rapidity Virginia succumbed to ruin, while continuing
to support the system that was draining her
strength. No episode in American history was more
touching than the generous devotion with which Virginia
clung to the embargo, and drained the poison
which her own President held obstinately to her lips.
The cotton and rice States had less to lose, and could
more easily bear bankruptcy; ruin was to them—except
in Charleston—a word of little meaning; but
the old society of Virginia could never be restored.
Amid the harsh warnings of John Randolph it saw
its agonies approach; and its last representative,
heir to all its honors and dignities, President Jefferson
himself woke from his long dream of power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
only to find his own fortunes buried in the ruin he
had made.</p>

<p>Except in a state of society verging on primitive
civilization, the stoppage of all foreign intercourse
could not have been attempted by peaceable means.
The attempt to deprive the laborer of sugar, salt,
tea, coffee, molasses, and rum; to treble the price of
every yard of coarse cottons and woollens; to reduce
by one half the wages of labor, and to double its burdens,—this
was a trial more severe than war; and
even when attempted by the whole continent of Europe,
with all the resources of manufactures and
wealth which the civilization of a thousand years had
supplied, the experiment required the despotic power
of Napoleon and the united armies of France, Austria,
and Russia to carry it into effect. Even then it failed.
Jefferson, Madison, and the Southern Republicans
had no idea of the economical difficulties their system
created, and were surprised to find American
society so complex even in their own Southern
States that the failure of two successive crops to find
a sale threatened beggary to every rich planter from
the Delaware to the Sabine. During the first few
months, while ships continued to arrive from abroad
and old stores were consumed at home, the full
pressure of the embargo was not felt; but as the
summer of 1808 passed, the outcry became violent.
In the Southern States, almost by common consent
debts remained unpaid, and few men ventured to
oppose a political system which was peculiarly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Southern invention; but in the Northern States,
where the bankrupt laws were enforced and the
habits of business were comparatively strict, the
cost of the embargo was soon shown in the form
of political revolution.</p>

<p>The relapse of Massachusetts to Federalism and
the overthrow of Senator Adams in the spring of
1808 were the first signs of the political price which
President Jefferson must pay for his passion of peace.
In New York the prospect was little better. Governor
Morgan Lewis, elected in 1804 over Aaron Burr by a
combination of Clintons and Livingstons, was turned
out of office in 1807 by the Clintons. Governor
Daniel D. Tompkins, his successor, was supposed to
be a representative of De Witt Clinton and Ambrose
Spencer. To De Witt Clinton the State of New York
seemed in 1807 a mere appendage,—a political property
which he could control at will; and of all American
politicians next to Aaron Burr none had shown
such indifference to party as he. No one could predict
his course, except that it would be shaped according
to what seemed to be the interests of his ambition.
He began by declaring himself against the embargo,
and soon afterward declared himself for it. In truth,
he was for or against it as the majority might decide;
and in New York a majority could hardly fail to decide
against the embargo. At the spring election
of 1808, which took place about May 1, the Federalists
made large gains in the legislature. The summer
greatly increased their strength, until Madison’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
friends trembled for the result, and their language
became despondent beyond reason. Gallatin, who
knew best the difficulties created by the embargo,
began to despair. June 29 he wrote: “From present
appearances the Federalists will turn us out by 4th
of March next.” Ten days afterward he explained
the reason of his fears: “I think that Vermont is
lost; New Hampshire is in a bad neighborhood; and
Pennsylvania is extremely doubtful.” In August he
thought the situation so serious that he warned the
President:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is almost an equal chance that if propositions
from Great Britain, or other events, do not put it in
our power to raise the embargo before the 1st of October,
we will lose the Presidential election. I think that
at this moment the Western States, Virginia, South Carolina,
and perhaps Georgia are the only sound States, and
that we will have a doubtful contest in every other.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Two causes saved Madison. In the first place, the
opposition failed to concentrate its strength. Neither
George Clinton nor James Monroe could control the
whole body of opponents to the embargo. After waiting
till the middle of August for some arrangement
to be made, leading Federalists held a conference at
New York, where they found themselves obliged, by
the conduct of De Witt Clinton, to give up the hope
of a coalition. Clinton decided not to risk his fortunes
for the sake of his uncle the Vice-President;
and this decision obliged the Federalists to put a candidate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
of their own in the field. They named C. C.
Pinckney of South Carolina for President, and Rufus
King of New York for Vice-President, as in 1804.</p>

<p>From the moment his opponents divided themselves
among three candidates, Madison had nothing
to fear; but even without this good fortune he possessed
an advantage that weighed decisively in his
favor. The State legislatures had been chosen chiefly
in the spring or summer, when the embargo was
still comparatively popular; and in most cases, but
particularly in New York, the legislature still chose
Presidential electors. The people expressed no direct
opinion on national politics, except in regard to
Congressmen. State after State deserted to the Federalists
without affecting the general election. Early
in September Vermont elected a Federalist governor,
but the swarm of rotten boroughs in the State
secured a Republican legislature, which immediately
chose electors for Madison. The revolution in Vermont
surrendered all New England to the Federalists.
New Hampshire chose Presidential electors
by popular vote; Rhode Island did the same,—and
both States, by fair majorities, rejected Madison and
voted for Pinckney. In Massachusetts and Connecticut
the legislatures chose Federalist electors. Thus
all New England declared against the Administration;
and had Vermont been counted as she voted
in September, the opposition would have received
forty-five electoral votes from New England, where
in 1804 it had received only nine. In New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
the opponents of the embargo were very strong,
and the nineteen electoral votes of that State might
in a popular election have been taken from Madison.
In this case Pennsylvania would have decided the
result. Eighty-eight electoral votes were needed
for a choice. New England, New York, and Delaware
represented sixty-seven. Maryland and North
Carolina were so doubtful that if Pennsylvania
had deserted Madison, they would probably have followed
her, and would have left the Republican party
a wreck.</p>

<p>The choice of electors by the legislatures of Vermont
and New York defeated all chance of overthrowing
Madison; but apart from these accidents
of management the result was already decided by the
people of Pennsylvania. The wave of Federalist
success and political revolution stopped short in New
York, and once more the Democracy of Pennsylvania
steadied and saved the Administration. At the October
election of 1808,—old Governor McKean having
at last retired,—Simon Snyder was chosen governor
by a majority of more than twenty thousand votes.
The new governor was the candidate of Duane and
the extreme Democrats; his triumph stopped the
current of Federalist success, and enabled Madison’s
friends to drive hesitating Republicans back to their
party. In Virginia, Monroe was obliged to retire
from the contest, and his supporters dwindled in
numbers until only two or three thousand went to
the polls. In New York, De Witt Clinton contented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
himself with taking from Madison six of the
nineteen electoral votes and giving them to Vice-President
Clinton. Thus the result showed comparatively
little sign of the true Republican loss; yet in
the electoral college where in 1804 Jefferson had
received the voices of one hundred and sixty-two
electors, Madison in 1808 received only one hundred
and twenty-two votes. The Federalist minority rose
from fourteen to forty-seven.</p>

<p>In the elections to Congress the same effects were
shown. The Federalists doubled their number of
Congressmen, but the huge Republican majority could
well bear reduction. The true character of the
Eleventh Congress could not be foretold by the party
vote. Many Northern Republicans chosen to Congress
were as hostile to the embargo as though they
had been Federalists. Elected on the issue of embargo
or anti-embargo, the Congress which was to
last till March 5, 1811, was sure to be factious; but
whether factious or united, it could have neither
policy nor leader. The election decided its own
issue. The true issue thenceforward was that of
war; but on this point the people had not been
asked to speak, and their representatives would not
dare without their encouragement to act.</p>

<p>The Republican party by a supreme effort kept
itself in office; but no one could fail to see that if
nine months of embargo had so shattered Jefferson’s
power, another such year would shake the Union itself.
The cost of this “engine for national purposes”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
exceeded all calculation. Financially, it emptied the
Treasury, bankrupted the mercantile and agricultural
class, and ground the poor beyond endurance. Constitutionally,
it overrode every specified limit on arbitrary
power and made Congress despotic, while it
left no bounds to the authority which might be vested
by Congress in the President. Morally, it sapped the
nation’s vital force, lowering its courage, paralyzing
its energy, corrupting its principles, and arraying all
the active elements of society in factious opposition
to government or in secret paths of treason. Politically,
it cost Jefferson the fruits of eight years
painful labor for popularity, and brought the Union
to the edge of a precipice.</p>

<p>Finally, frightful as the cost of this engine was, as
a means of coercion the embargo evidently failed.
The President complained of evasion, and declared
that if the measure were faithfully executed it would
produce the desired effect; but the people knew
better. In truth, the law was faithfully executed.
The price-lists of Liverpool and London, the published
returns from Jamaica and Havana, proved
that American produce was no longer to be bought
abroad. On the continent of Europe commerce had
ceased before the embargo was laid, and its coercive
effects were far exceeded by Napoleon’s own restrictions;
yet not a sign came from Europe to show that
Napoleon meant to give way. From England came
an answer to the embargo, but not such as promised
its success. On all sides evidence accumulated that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
the embargo, as an engine of coercion, needed a long
period of time to produce a decided effect. The law
of physics could easily be applied to politics; force
could be converted only into its equivalent force. If
the embargo—an exertion of force less violent than
war—was to do the work of war, it must extend
over a longer time the development of an equivalent
energy. Wars lasted for many years, and the embargo
must be calculated to last much longer than
any war; but meanwhile the morals, courage, and
political liberties of the American people must be
perverted or destroyed: agriculture and shipping must
perish; the Union itself could not be preserved.</p>

<p>Under the shock of these discoveries Jefferson’s
vast popularity vanished, and the labored fabric of
his reputation fell in sudden and general ruin.
America began slowly to struggle, under the consciousness
of pain, toward a conviction that she must
bear the common burdens of humanity, and fight
with the weapons of other races in the same bloody
arena; that she could not much longer delude herself
with hopes of evading laws of Nature and instincts
of life; and that her new statesmanship which made
peace a passion could lead to no better result than
had been reached by the barbarous system which
made war a duty.</p>

<p>While the people of the United States waited
to see the effect of the embargo on Europe, Europe
watched with breathless interest the death-throes of
Spain.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon, in December, 1807, hurried
in triumphal progress from one ancient city to
another, through his Italian kingdom, while his
armies steadily crossed the Pyrenees, and spread over
every road between Bayonne and Lisbon. From
Madrid, Godoy saw that the end was near. Until
that moment he had counted with certainty on the
devotion of the Spanish people to their old King.
In the last months of 1807 he learned that even
Spanish loyalty could not survive the miseries of such
a reign. Conspiracy appeared in the Escorial itself.
Ferdinand, Prince of the Asturias, only son of Don
Carlos IV., was discovered in a plot for dethroning
his father by aid of Napoleon. Ferdinand was but
twenty-three years old; yet even in the flower of
youth he showed no social quality. Dull, obstinate,
sullen, just shrewd enough to be suspicious, and with
just enough passion to make him vindictive, Ferdinand
was destined to become the last and worst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
the Spanish Bourbon kings; yet in the year 1807 he
had a strong bond of sympathy with the people, for
he hated and feared his father and mother and the
Prince of Peace. Public patience, exhausted by endless
disaster, and outraged by the King’s incompetence,
the Queen’s supposed amours, and Godoy’s
parade of royal rank and power, vanished at the news
that Ferdinand shared in the popular disgust; and
the Prince of Peace suddenly woke to find the old
King already dethroned in his subjects’ love, while
the Prince of the Asturias, who was fitted only for
confinement in an asylum, had become the popular
ideal of virtue and reform.</p>

<p>Godoy stifled Ferdinand’s intrigue, and took from
Napoleon that pretext for interference; but he gained
at most only a brief respite for King Charles. The
pardon of Ferdinand was issued Nov. 5, 1807; December
23, Napoleon sent from Milan to his minister
of war orders<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> to concentrate armies for occupying
the whole peninsula, and to establish the magazines
necessary for their support. He was almost ready
to act; and his return to Paris, Jan. 3, 1808, announced
to those who were in the secret that the
new drama would soon begin.</p>

<p>Among the most interested of his audience was
General Armstrong, who had longed, since 1805, for
a chance to meet the Emperor with his own weapons,
and who knew that Napoleon’s schemes required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
control of North and South America, which would
warrant Jefferson in imposing rather than in receiving
terms for Florida. Whatever these terms might
be, Napoleon must grant them, or must yield the
Americas to England’s naval supremacy. The plan
as Armstrong saw it was both safe and sure. Napoleon
made no secret of his wants. Whatever finesse
he may have used in the earlier stage of his policy
was flung aside after his return to Paris, January 3.
In reply to Armstrong’s remonstrances against the
Milan Decree, the Emperor ordered Champagny to
use the language of command:<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Answer Mr. Armstrong, that I am ashamed to discuss
points of which the injustice is so evident; but that in
the position in which England has put the Continent, I
do not doubt of the United States declaring war against
her, especially on account of her decree of November 11;
that however great may be the evil resulting to America
from war, every man of sense will prefer it to a recognition
of the monstrous principles and of the anarchy which
that Government wants to establish on the seas; that in
my mind I regard war as declared between England and
America from the day when England published her decrees;
that, for the rest, I have ordered that the American
vessels should remain sequestered, to be disposed of
as shall be necessary according to circumstances.”</p>
</div>

<p>No coarser methods were known to diplomacy than
those which Napoleon commonly took whenever the
moment for action came. Not only did he thus hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
millions of American property sequestered as a pledge
for the obedience of America, but he also offered a
bribe to the United States government. January 28
he gave orders<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> for the occupation of Barcelona and
the Spanish frontier as far as the Ebro, and for pushing
a division from Burgos to Aranda on the direct
road to Madrid. These orders admitted of no disguise;
they announced the annexation of Spain to
France. A few days afterward, February 2, the
Emperor began to dispose of Spanish territory as
already his own.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Let the American minister know verbally,” he wrote
to Champagny,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> “that whenever war shall be declared
between America and England, and whenever in consequence
of this war the Americans shall send troops into
the Floridas to help the Spaniards and repulse the English,
I shall much approve of it. You will even let him
perceive (<i>vous lui laisserez même entrevoir</i>) that in case
America should be disposed to enter into a treaty of alliance,
and make common cause with me, I shall not be
unwilling (<i>éloigné</i>) to intervene with the court of Spain
to obtain the cession of these same Floridas in favor of
the Americans.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next day Champagny sent for Armstrong and
gave him a verbal message, which the American minister
understood as follows:<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“General, I have to communicate to you a message
from the Emperor. I am instructed to say that the measure
of taking the Floridas, to the exclusion of the British,
meets entirely the approbation of his Majesty. I
understand that you wish to purchase the Floridas. If
such be your wish, I am further instructed to say that his
Majesty will interest himself with Spain in such way as
to obtain for you the Floridas, and, what is still more
important, a convenient western boundary for Louisiana,
on condition that the United States will enter into an
alliance with France.”</p>
</div>

<p>Weary of verbal and semi-official advances, Armstrong
determined to put this overture on record, and
in doing so, to tell the Emperor plainly the price
of American friendship. February 5 he wrote to
Champagny a note, embodying the message as he
understood it, and promising to convey it to the
President.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I should little deserve,” he added, “and still less
reciprocate the frankness of this declaration, were I to
withhold from your Excellency my belief that the present
conduct of France toward the commerce of the United
States, so far from promoting the views of his Majesty,
are directly calculated to contravene them. That the
United States are at this moment on the eve of a war
with Great Britain on account of certain outrages committed
against their rights as a neutral nation is a fact
abundantly and even generally known. Another fact,
scarcely less known, is that under these circumstances
France also has proceeded, in many instances and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
various means, to violate these very rights. In both
cases all the injunctions of public law have been equally
forgotten; but between the two we cannot fail to remark
a conspicuous difference. With Great Britain the United
States could invoke no particular treaty providing rights
supplementary to these injunctions; but such was not
their situation with France. With her a treaty did exist,
... a treaty sanctioned with the name and guaranteed
by the promise of the Emperor ‘that all its obligations
should be inviolably preserved.’”</p>
</div>

<p>This was hardly the reply which the Emperor expected;
but, temper for temper, Napoleon was not a
man to be thus challenged by a mere diplomatist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You must write to the American minister,” was his
order to Champagny,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> “that France has taken engagements
with America, has made with her a treaty founded
on the principle that the flag covers the goods, and that
if this sacred principle had not been solemnly proclaimed,
his Majesty would still proclaim it; that his Majesty
treated with America independent, and not with America
enslaved (<i>asservie</i>); that if she submits to the King of
England’s Decree of November 11, she renounces thereby
the protection of her flag; but that if the Americans,
as his Majesty cannot doubt without wounding
their honor, regard this act as one of hostility, the Emperor
is ready to do justice in every respect.”</p>
</div>

<p>In forwarding these documents to Washington,
Armstrong expressed in plain language his opinion
of Napoleon and Champagny. “With one hand they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
offer us the blessings of equal alliance against Great
Britain; with the other they menace us with war if
we do not accept this kindness; and with both they
pick our pockets with all imaginable diligence, dexterity,
and impudence.” Armstrong’s patience was
exhausted. He besought the Government to select its
enemy, either France or England; but “in either case
do not suspend a moment the seizure of the Floridas.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
A week afterward he wrote to Madison
that “in a council of Administration held a few days
past, when it was proposed to modify the operation
of the Decrees of November, 1806, and December,
1807, though the proposition was supported by the
whole weight of the council, the Emperor became
highly indignant, and declared that these decrees
should suffer no change, and that the Americans
should be compelled to take the positive character
either of allies or of enemies.”<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>These letters from Armstrong, enclosing Champagny’s
version of Napoleon’s blunt words, were
despatched to Washington during the month of
February; and, as the story has already shown,
President Jefferson roused a storm against France
by communicating to Congress the Emperor’s order
that the United States government should regard itself
as at war with England. Turreau felt the publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
as a fatal blow to his influence; but even
Turreau, soldier as he was, could never appreciate
the genius of his master’s audacity. Napoleon knew
his ground. From the moment England adopted the
Orders in Council the United States were necessarily
a party in the war, and no process of evasion or
delay could more than disguise their position. Napoleon
told Jefferson this plain truth, and offered
him the Floridas as a bribe to declare himself on
the side of France. These advances were made before
the embargo system was fairly known or fully
understood at Paris; and the policy of peaceable
coercion, as applied to England, had not been considered
in the Emperor’s plans. Alliance or war seemed
to him the necessary alternative, and from that point
of view America had no reason or right to complain
because he disregarded treaty stipulations which
had become a dead letter.</p>

<p>All this while the Emperor held Spain in suspense,
but February 21 he gave orders for securing
the royal family. Murat was to occupy Madrid;
Admiral Rosily, who commanded a French squadron
at Cadiz, was to bar the way “if the Spanish Court,
owing to events or a folly that can hardly be expected,
should wish to renew the scene of Lisbon.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
Godoy saw the impending blow, and ordered the
Court to Cadiz, intending to carry the King even
to Mexico if no other resource remained. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
perhaps have saved the King, and Admiral Rosily
himself would have been the prisoner, had not the
people risen in riot on hearing of the intended flight.
March 17 a sudden mob sacked Godoy’s house at
Aranjuez, hunting him down like a wild beast, and
barely failing to take his life; while by sheer terror
Don Carlos IV. was made to abdicate the throne in
favor of his son Ferdinand. March 19 the ancient
Spanish empire crumbled away.</p>

<p>Owing to the skill with which Napoleon had sucked
every drop of blood from the veins, and paralyzed
every nerve in the limbs of the Spanish monarchy,
the throne fell without apparent touch from him,
and his army entered Madrid as though called to
protect Carlos IV. from violence. When the news
reached Paris the Emperor, April 2, hurried to
Bordeaux and Bayonne, where he remained until
August, regulating his new empire. To Bayonne
were brought all the familiar figures of the old
Spanish <i>régime</i>,—Carlos IV., Queen Luisa, Ferdinand,
the Prince of Peace, Don Pedro Cevallos,—the
last remnants of picturesque Spain; and
Napoleon passed them in review with the curiosity
which he might have shown in regarding a collection
of rococo furniture. His victims always
interested him, except when, as in the case of
Toussaint Louverture, they were not of noble birth.
King Charles, he said,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> looked a <i>bon et brave
homme</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not know whether it is due to his position or
to the circumstances, but he has the air of a patriarch,
frank and good. The Queen carries her heart and history
on her face; you need to know nothing more of
her. The Prince of Peace has the air of a bull; something
like Daru. He is beginning to recover his senses;
he has been treated with unexampled barbarity. It is
well to discharge him of every false imputation, but he
must be left covered with a slight tinge of contempt.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was a compliment to Godoy; for Napoleon
made it his rule to throw contempt only upon persons—like
the Queen of Prussia, or Mme. de Staël,
or Toussaint—whose influence he feared. Of Ferdinand,
Napoleon could make nothing, and became
almost humorous in attempting to express the antipathy
which this last Spanish Bourbon aroused.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The King of Prussia is a hero in comparison with
the Prince of the Asturias. He has not yet said a word
to me; he is indifferent to everything; very material;
eats four times a day, and has no ideas; ... sullen
and stupid.”</p>
</div>

<p>Madrid and Aranjuez, the Escorial and La Granja
were to know King Charles and his court no more.
After showing themselves for a few days at Bayonne,
these relics of the eighteenth century disappeared to
Compiègne, to Valençay, to one refuge after another,
until in 1814 unhappy Spain welcomed back the
sullen and stupid Ferdinand, only to learn his true
character; while old King Charles, beggared and forgotten,
dragged out a melancholy existence in Italy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
served to the last by Godoy with a loyalty that half
excused his faults and vices. The Bourbon rubbish
was swept from Madrid; Don Carlos had already
abdicated; Ferdinand, entrapped and terrified, was
set aside; the old palaces were garnished for newcomers;
and after Lucien and Louis Bonaparte had
refused the proffered throne, Napoleon sent to Naples
for Joseph, who was crowned, June 15, King
of Spain at Bayonne.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Spanish people woke to consciousness
that their ancient empire had become a province
of France, and their exasperation broke into acts of
wild revenge. May 2 Madrid rose in an insurrection
which Murat suppressed by force. Several hundred
lives on either side were lost; and although the affair
itself was one of no great importance, it had results
which made the day an epoch in modern history.</p>

<p>The gradual breaking up of the old European
system of politics was marked by an anniversary
among each of the Western nations. The English
race dated from July 4, 1776, the beginning of a
new era; the French celebrated July 14, 1789,
the capture of the Bastille, as decisive of their destinies.
For a time, Bonaparte’s <i>coup d’état</i> of the
18th Brumaire in 1799 forced both France and
England back on their steps; but the dethronement
of Charles IV. began the process in a new direction.
The Second of May—or as the Spaniards
called it, the Dos de Maio—swept the vast Spanish
empire into the vortex of dissolution. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
of the other anniversaries—that of July 4, 1776,
and of July 14, 1789—had been followed by a
long and bloody convulsion which ravaged large portions
of the world; and the extent and violence
of the convulsion which was to ravage the Spanish
empire could be measured only by the vastness of
Spanish dominion. So strangely had political forces
been entangled by Napoleon’s hand, that the explosion
at Madrid roused the most incongruous interests
into active sympathy and strange companionship.
The Spaniards themselves, the least progressive people
in Europe, became by necessity democratic; not
only the people, but even the governments of Austria
and Germany felt the movement, and yielded to it;
the Tories of England joined with the Whigs and
Democrats in cheering a revolution which could not
but shake the foundations of Tory principles; confusion
became chaos, and while all Europe, except
France, joined hands in active or passive support of
Spanish freedom, America, the stronghold of free
government, drew back and threw her weight on
the opposite side. The workings of human development
were never more strikingly shown than in the
helplessness with which the strongest political and
social forces in the world followed or resisted at
haphazard the necessities of a movement which they
could not control or comprehend. Spain, France,
Germany, England, were swept into a vast and bloody
torrent which dragged America, from Montreal to
Valparaiso, slowly into its movement; while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
familiar figures of famous men,—Napoleon, Alexander,
Canning, Godoy, Jefferson, Madison, Talleyrand;
emperors, generals, presidents, conspirators,
patriots, tyrants, and martyrs by the thousand,—were
borne away by the stream, struggling, gesticulating,
praying, murdering, robbing; each blind to
everything but a selfish interest, and all helping more
or less unconsciously to reach the new level which
society was obliged to seek. Half a century of disorder
failed to settle the problems raised by the
Dos de Maio; but from the first even a child could
see that in the ruin of a world like the empire of
Spain, the only nation certain to find a splendid
and inexhaustible booty was the Republic of the
United States. To President Jefferson the Spanish
revolution opened an endless vista of democratic
ambition.</p>

<p>Yet at first the Dos de Maio seemed only to rivet
Napoleon’s power, and to strengthen the reaction begun
on the 18th Brumaire. The Emperor expected
local resistance, and was ready to suppress it. He
had dealt effectually with such popular outbreaks
in France, Italy, and Germany; he had been overcome
in St. Domingo not by the people, but, as he
believed, by the climate. If the Germans and Italians
could be made obedient to his orders, the Spaniards
could certainly offer no serious resistance. During
the two or three months that followed the dethronement
of the Bourbons, Napoleon stood at the summit
of his hopes. If the letters he then wrote were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
extant to prove the plans he had in mind, common-sense
would refuse to believe that schemes so unsubstantial
could have found lodgment in his brain.
The English navy and English commerce were to
be driven from the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian
Ocean, and American waters, until the ruin of England
should be accomplished, and the empire of the
world should be secured. Order rapidly followed
order for reconstructing the navies of France, Spain,
and Portugal. Great expeditions were to occupy
Ceuta, Egypt, Syria, Buenos Ayres, the Isle de France,
and the East Indies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The concurrence of these operations,” he wrote May
13,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> “will throw London into a panic. A single one
of them, that of India, will do horrible damage there.
England will then have no means of annoying us or of
disturbing America. I am resolved on this expedition.”</p>
</div>

<p>For this purpose the Emperor required not only
the submission of Spain, but also the support of
Spanish America and of the United States. He
acted as though he were already master of all these
countries, which were not yet within his reach.
Continuing to treat the United States as a dependent
government, he issued April 17 a new order
directing the seizure of all American vessels which
should enter the ports of France, Italy, and the
Hanse towns.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> This measure, which became famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
as the Bayonne Decree, surpassed the Decrees of
Berlin and Milan in violence, and was gravely justified
by Napoleon on the ground that, since the
embargo, no vessel of the United States could navigate
the seas without violating the law of its own
government, and furnishing a presumption that it
did so with false papers, on British account or in
British connection. “This is very ingenious,” wrote
Armstrong in reporting the fact.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Yet it was hardly
more arbitrary or unreasonable than the British
“Rule of 1756,” which declared that a neutral should
practise no trade with a belligerent which it had not
practised with the same nation during peace.</p>

<p>While these portentous events were passing rapidly
before the eyes of Europe, no undue haste marked
Madison’s movements. Champagny’s letter of Jan.
15, 1808, arrived and was sent to Congress toward
the end of March; but although the United States
quickly knew by heart Napoleon’s phrase, “War exists
in fact between England and the United States,
and his Majesty considers it as declared from the day
on which England published her decrees;” although
Rose departed March 22, and the embargo was
shaped into a system of coercion long before Rose’s
actual departure,—yet Congress waited until April
22 before authorizing the President to suspend the
embargo, if he could succeed in persuading or compelling
England or France to withdraw the belligerent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
decrees; and not until May 2—the famous
Dos de Maio—did Madison send to Armstrong instructions
which were to guide that minister through
the dangers of Napoleonic diplomacy.</p>

<p>The Secretary began by noticing Champagny’s letter
of January 15, which had assumed to declare war
for the United States government.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That [letter],” said Madison,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> “... has, as you
will see by the papers herewith sent, produced all the
sensations here which the spirit and style of it were
calculated to excite in minds alive to the interests and
honor of the nation. To present to the United States
the alternative of bending to the views of France against
her enemy, or of incurring a confiscation of all the property
of their citizens carried into the French prize courts,
implied that they were susceptible of impressions by
which no independent and honorable nation can be
guided; and to prejudge and pronounce for them the
effect which the conduct of another nation ought to have
on their councils and course of proceeding, had the air
at least of an assumed authority not less irritating to
the public feeling. In these lights the President makes
it your duty to present to the French government the
contents of Mr. Champagny’s letter; taking care, as
your discretion will doubtless suggest, that while you
make that Government sensible of the offensive tone
employed, you leave the way open for friendly and
respectful explanations, if there be a disposition to offer
them, and for a decision here on any reply which may
be of a different character.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>
<p>While Armstrong waited for Napoleon’s “friendly
and respectful explanations,” he was to study the
Act of Congress which vested in the President an
authority to suspend the embargo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conditions on which the suspending authority
is to be exercised will engage your particular attention.
They appeal equally to the justice and the policy of the
two great belligerent Powers now emulating each other in
violations of both. The President counts on your best
endeavors to give to this appeal all the effect possible
with the French government. Mr. Pinkney will be doing
the same with that of Great Britain.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Florida affair remained to be discussed. The
President courteously acknowledged the Emperor’s
wishes “for an accession of the United States to
the war against England, as an inducement to which
his interposition would be employed with Spain to
obtain for them the Floridas.” Armstrong was told
to say in reply “that the United States having
chosen as the basis of their policy a fair and sincere
neutrality among the contending Powers, they
are disposed to adhere to it as long as their essential
interests will permit, and are more particularly disinclined
to become a party to the complicated and
general warfare which agitates another quarter of
the globe, for the purpose of obtaining a separate
and particular object, however interesting to them;
but,” Madison added, “should circumstances demand
from the United States a precautionary occupation
against the hostile designs of Great Britain, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
be recollected with satisfaction that the measure has
received his Majesty’s approbation.” Finally, Armstrong’s
advice to seize the Floridas without delay
was answered only by the singular remark that the
Emperor had given no reason to suppose he would
approve the step. In private Jefferson gave other
explanations, but perhaps he most nearly expressed
his true feeling when he added that Armstrong wrote
“so much in the buskin that he cannot give a naked
fact in an intelligible form.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Turreau, who stood nearer than any other man to
the secrets of American foreign politics, attempted
to draw the President from this defensive attitude.
Turreau’s instructions were such as to warrant him
in using strong language. In a despatch dated February
15, Champagny repeated to his minister at
Washington in still plainer words the substance of
what had been said to Armstrong: “Some American
ships have been seized, but the Emperor contents
himself for the moment with holding them in
sequestration. His conduct toward the Americans
will depend on the conduct of the United States
toward England.” As previously to Armstrong, so
again to Turreau, the threat was supported by the
bribe:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Emperor, wishing on this occasion to establish
a still more intimate union of interests between America
and France, has authorized me to notify Mr. Armstrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
verbally that if England should make any movement
against the Floridas, he would not take it ill if the United
States should move troops there for defence. You will
be cautious in making use of this communication, which
is purely conditional, and can take effect only in case the
Floridas are attacked.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Not until late in the month of June did Turreau
find an opportunity to talk at his ease with the
President and Secretary of State; but, as usual, his
account of the conversation was interesting.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> He
began with Madison; and after listening with some
impatience to the Secretary’s long list of complaints,
he brought forward the suggestion of alliance:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I watched the Secretary of State, and the experience
I have in dealing with him made me easily perceive that
my proposal embarrassed him; so he replied in an evasive
manner. At last, finding himself too hard pressed, for
a third time he said to me ‘that the intention of the
Federal government was to observe the most exact impartiality
between France and England.’ ‘You have
departed from it,’ said I, ‘when you place the two
Powers on the same line relatively to their conduct
toward you.’... ‘Well,’ said he, ‘we must wait the
decision of the next Congress with regard to the embargo;
doubtless it will be raised in favor of the Power
which shall first recall the measures that harass our commerce.’”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>For three hours Turreau lectured the secretary on
the iniquities of England, while the secretary doggedly
repeated his phrases. Wearied but not satisfied, the
French minister abandoned Madison and attacked the
President. Jefferson entertained him with a long list
of complaints against Spain, which Turreau had heard
so often as to know them by memory. When at last
the conversation had been brought to the subject of
alliance against England, Jefferson took a new view
of the situation, which hardly agreed with that taken
by the Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have complained,” replied the President, “that
in consequence of our measures and of the proceedings of
the last Congress, France has been put on a level with
England in regard to the wrongs we allege against both
Powers, while there was no kind of analogy either in the
date or the gravity of their wrongs toward the Americans.
I am going to prove to you generally that we
never intended to admit any comparison in the conduct
of these two Powers, by recalling to you the effect of the
very measures you complain of. The embargo, which
seems to strike at France and Great Britain equally, is in
fact more prejudicial to the latter than to the former, by
reason of the greater number of colonies which England
possesses, and their inferiority in local resources.”</p>
</div>

<p>After pursuing this line of argument Jefferson reverted
to his own policy, and made an advance toward
an understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is possible,” he said, “that Congress may repeal
the embargo, the continuation of which would do us
more harm than a state of war. For us in the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
situation all is loss; whereas, however powerful the
English may be, war would put us in a way of doing
them much harm, because our people are enterprising.
Yet as it is probable that Congress will favor raising
the embargo if the Orders in Council are withdrawn, it
would be necessary for your interests, if you are unwilling
to withdraw your decrees, that at least you should
promise their withdrawal on condition that the embargo
be withdrawn in your favor. You will also observe that
were the embargo withdrawn in favor of the English,
this will not close our differences with them, because
never—no, never—will there be an arrangement with
them if they do not renounce the impressment of our
seamen on our ships.”</p>
</div>

<p>With this avowal, which Turreau understood as a
sort of pledge that Jefferson would lean toward war
with England rather than with France, the French
minister was obliged to content himself; while he
pressed on his Government the assurance that both
the President and the secretary wished more than all
else to obtain the Floridas. Such reports were little
calculated to change the Emperor’s course. Human
ingenuity discovered but one way to break Napoleon’s
will, and this single method was that of showing
power to break his plans.</p>

<p>In due time Armstrong received his instructions
of May 2, and wrote June 10 to Champagny a
note declining the proposed alliance, and expressing
the satisfaction which his Government felt at hearing
the Emperor’s approval of “a cautionary occupation
of the Floridas.” Napoleon, who was still at Bayonne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
in the flush of his power, no sooner read this reply
than he wrote to Champagny,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Answer the American minister that you do not know
what he means about the occupation of the Floridas; and
that the Americans, being at peace with the Spaniards,
cannot occupy the Floridas without the permission or the
request of the King of Spain.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong, a few days afterward, was astonished
by receiving from Champagny a note<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> denying positively
that any suggestion had ever been made to
warrant an American occupation of the Floridas
without an express request from the King of Spain:
“The Emperor has neither the right nor the wish to
authorize an infraction of international law, contrary
to the interests of an independent Power, his ally and
his friend.” When Napoleon chose to deny a fact,
argument was thrown away; yet Armstrong could
not do otherwise than recall Champagny’s own words,
which he did in a formal note, and there left the
matter at rest, writing to his Government that the
change in tone had “no doubt grown out of the new
relations which the Floridas bear to this government
since the abdication of Charles IV.”<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>For once Armstrong was too charitable. He might
safely have assumed that Napoleon was also continuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
the same coarse game he had played since
April, 1803,—snatching away the lure he loved to
dangle before Jefferson’s eyes, punishing the Americans
for refusing his offer of alliance, and making
them feel the constant pressure of his will. They
were fortunate if he did not at once confiscate
the property he had sequestered. Indeed, not only
did his seizures of American property continue even
more rigorously than before,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> but such French frigates
as could keep at sea actually burned and sunk
American ships that came in their way. The Bayonne
Decree was enforced like a declaration of war.
The Emperor tolerated no remonstrance. At Bayonne,
July 6, he had an interview with one of the
Livingstons, who was on his way to America as
bearer of despatches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are obliged to embargo your ships,” said the
Emperor;<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> “they keep up a trade with England; they
come to Holland and elsewhere with English goods; England
has made them tributary to her. This I will not
suffer. Tell the President from me when you see him in
America that if he can make a treaty with England, preserving
his maritime rights, it will be agreeable to me;
but that I will make war upon the universe, should it
support her unjust pretensions. I will not abate any
part of my system.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet in one respect he made a concession. He no
longer required a declaration of war from the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
States. The embargo seemed to him, as to Jefferson,
an act of hostility to England which answered the
immediate wants of France. In the report on foreign
relations, dated Sept. 1, 1808, Napoleon expressed
publicly his approval of the embargo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Americans,—this people who placed their fortune,
their prosperity, and almost their existence in
commerce,—have given the example of a great and
courageous sacrifice. By a general embargo they have
interdicted all commerce, all exchange, rather than
shamefully submit to that tribute which the English
pretend to impose on the shipping of all nations.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong, finding that his advice was not even
considered at home, withdrew from affairs. After
obeying his instructions of May 2, and recording
the conventional protest against Napoleon’s uncivil
tone,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> he secluded himself, early in August, at the
baths of Bourbon l’Archambault, one hundred and
fifty miles from Paris, and nursed his rheumatism
till autumn. Thither followed him instructions from
Madison, dated July 21,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> directing him to present
the case of the burned vessels “in terms which may
awaken the French government to the nature of the
injury and the demands of justice;” but the limit of
Armstrong’s patience was reached, and he flatly refused
to obey. Any new experiment made at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
moment, he said, would certainly be useless and perhaps
injurious:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This opinion, formed with the utmost circumspection,
is not only a regular inference from the ill success of my
past endeavors, which have hitherto produced only palliations,
and which have latterly failed to produce these,
but a direct consequence of the most authentic information
that the Emperor does not, on this subject and at
this time, exercise even the small degree of patience
proper to his character.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Finally Armstrong summed up the results of Jefferson’s
policy so far as France was concerned, in a
letter<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> dated August 30, which carried candor to the
point of severity:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have somewhat overrated our means of coercing
the two great belligerents to a course of justice. The
embargo is a measure calculated above any other to keep
us whole and keep us in peace; but beyond this you must
not count upon it. Here it is not felt, and in England ... it
is forgotten. I hope that unless France shall do
us justice we will raise the embargo, and make in its
stead the experiment of an armed commerce. Should
she adhere to her wicked and foolish measures, we ought
not to content ourselves with doing this. There is much,
very much, besides that we can do; and we ought not to
omit doing all we can, because it is believed here that we
cannot do much, and even that we will not do what we
have the power of doing.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for Jefferson, the answer made by
Spain, May 2, to Napoleon’s orders was not couched
in the terms which the United States government
used on the same day. Joseph Bonaparte, entering
his new kingdom, found himself a king without subjects.
Arriving July 20 at Madrid, Joseph heard
nothing but news of rebellion and disaster. On that
day some twenty thousand French troops under General
Dupont, advancing on Seville and Cadiz, were
surrounded in the Sierra Morena, and laid down their
arms to a patriot Spanish force. A few days afterward
the French fleet at Cadiz surrendered. A patriot
Junta assumed the government of Spain. Quick
escape from Madrid became Joseph’s most pressing
necessity if he were to save his life. During one July
week he reigned over his gloomy capital, and fled,
July 29, with all the French forces still uncaptured,
to the provinces beyond the Ebro.</p>

<p>This disaster was quickly followed by another.
Junot and his army, far beyond support at Lisbon,
suddenly learned that a British force under Arthur
Wellesley had landed, August 1, about one hundred
miles to the north of Lisbon, and was marching on
that city. Junot had no choice but to fight, and
August 21 he lost the battle of Vimieiro. August
30, at Cintra, he consented to evacuate Portugal,
on condition that he and his twenty-two thousand
men should be conveyed by sea to France.</p>

<p>Never before in Napoleon’s career had he received
two simultaneous shocks so violent. The whole of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
Spain and Portugal, from Lisbon to Saragossa, by
a spasmodic effort freed itself from Bonaparte or
Bourbon; but this was nothing,—a single campaign
would recover the peninsula. The real blow was
in the loss of Cadiz and Lisbon, of the fleets and
work-shops that were to restore French power on
the ocean. Most fatal stroke of all, the Spanish
colonies were thenceforward beyond reach, and the
dream of universal empire was already dissolved
into ocean mist. Napoleon had found the limits
of his range, and saw the power of England rise,
more defiant than ever, over the ruin and desolation
of Spain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>When Parliament met Jan. 21, 1808, the paroxysm
of excitement which followed the “Chesapeake”
affair and the attack on Copenhagen had begun to
subside. War with America was less popular than it
had been six months before. The “Morning Post”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
exhorted the British public to maintain “that sublime
pitch” from which all opposition was to be
crushed; but the Whigs came to Parliament eager
for attack, while Perceval and Canning had exhausted
their energies, and were thrown back on a wearisome
defensive.</p>

<p>The session—which lasted from January 21 to
July 4—was remarkable chiefly for an obstinate
struggle over the Orders in Council. Against Perceval’s
commercial measures the Whigs bent the full
strength of their party; and this strength, so far as
intelligence was concerned, greatly outmatched that
of the Ministry. New men made reputations in the
conflict. In January, 1808, Alexander Baring—then
about thirty-four years of age, not yet in Parliament,
but second to no English merchant in standing—published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
a pamphlet, in reply to Stephen’s “War
in Disguise;” and his superior knowledge and abilities
gave, for the first time since 1776, solid ground
of support to American influence in British politics.
Side by side with Baring, a still younger man thrust
himself into public notice by force of qualities which
for half a century were to make him the object of
mixed admiration and laughter. The new American
champion, Henry Brougham, a native of Edinburgh,
thirty years of age, like many other Scotch lawyers
had come to seek and find at Westminster the great
prize of his profession. Like Baring, Brougham was
not yet in Parliament; but this obstacle—which
would have seemed to most men final—could not
prevent him from speaking his mind, even in presence
of the House.</p>

<p>Lord Grenville began the attack, and Canning the
defence, on the first day of the session; but not until
after January 27, when news of the embargo arrived,
and all immediate danger of war vanished, did the
situation become clear. February 5 the debate began.
The Whigs found that Perceval met their assaults
on the character and policy of his orders by
quotations from Lord Howick’s Order, which the
Whigs only twelve months before had issued and
defended as an act of retaliation. Narrow as this
personal rejoinder might be, it was fatal to the
Whig argument. Baring and Brougham might criticise
Spencer Perceval; but Lord Grenville and Lord
Howick had enough to do in explaining their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
words. The more vehement they became, the more
obstinately their opponents persevered in holding
them to this single point.</p>

<p>Yet the issue the Whigs wished to make was fairly
met. Government showed remarkable candor in
avowing the commercial object of the so-called retaliation.
Admitting that even if Napoleon had issued
no decrees England might have been obliged to enforce
the Rule of 1756, Spencer Perceval declared
that after the Berlin Decree a much stronger measure
was necessary in order to protect British commerce.
Lord Bathurst, Lord Hawkesbury, and Lord Castlereagh
took the same tone. Their argument, carried
to its ultimate conclusion, implied that Great Britain
might lawfully forbid every other nation to trade
with any country that imposed a prohibitive duty
on British manufactures. Not even a state of war
seemed essential to the soundness of the principle.</p>

<p>Already Lord Grenville had declared that “this
principle of forcing trade into our markets would
have disgraced the darkest ages of monopoly,”<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> when
March 8 Lord Erskine spoke in support of a series
of resolutions condemning the orders as contrary to
the Constitution, the laws of the realm, and the
rights of nations, and a violation of Magna Charta.
With especial energy he declaimed against Perceval’s
favorite doctrine of retaliation as applied to the
protection of British commerce. Lord Erskine, like
Lord Grenville, never spared epithets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is indeed quite astonishing,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> “to hear
the word ‘retaliation’ twisted and perverted in a manner
equally repugnant to grammar and common-sense....
It is a new application of the term, that if A strikes me,
I may retaliate by striking B.... I cannot, my Lords,
conceive anything more preposterous and senseless than
the idea of retaliation upon a neutral on whom the decree
has never been executed, because it is only by its
execution on him that we can be injured.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine supported his positions by a long professional
argument. Lord Chancellor Eldon replied by
developing international law in a direction till then
unexplored.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I would beg the House to consider what is meant by
the law of nations,” he began. “It is formed of an accumulation
of the dicta of wise men in different ages,
and applying to different circumstances, but none resembling
in any respect such a state of things as at
present exists in the face of the world. Indeed, none of
the writers upon the subject of this law appear to have
such a state in their contemplation. But yet nothing is
to be found in their writings which does not fully warrant
the right of self-defence and retaliation. Upon
that right the present ministers acted in advising those
Orders in Council, and upon the same right their predecessors
issued the order of the 7th of January.”</p>
</div>

<p>The doctrine that because international law wanted
the sanction of a well-defined force it was, strictly
speaking, no law at all, was naturally favored by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
school of common law; but Lord Eldon’s doctrine went
further, for he created a sanction of one-sided force
by which international law might supersede its own
principles. His brother, Sir William Scott, carried out
the theory by contending in the House of Commons
that “even if the French Decree was not acted upon
(which rested with the other party to prove), it
was nevertheless an injury, because it was an insult
to the country,”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>—a dictum which could hardly
find a parallel as the foundation for an attack on the
rights and property of an innocent third party.</p>

<p>Erskine’s Resolutions were of course rejected;
but meanwhile the merchants of the chief cities began
to protest. As the bill for carrying the orders
into effect came to its engrossment, March 7, the resistance
became hot. March 11 the bill passed the
House by a vote of 168 to 68; but Brougham had yet
to be heard, and no ordinary power was capable of
suppressing Henry Brougham. As counsel for the
American merchants of Liverpool, Manchester, and
London, he appeared March 18 at the bar of the
House, and for the next fortnight occupied most of
its time in producing testimony to prove that the
orders had ruinously affected the commercial interest.
April 1 he summed up the evidence in a
speech of three hours, which James Stephen thought
pernicious and incendiary.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Perceval was obliged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
produce witnesses on the other side; and Stephen,
who had been brought into Parliament for the purpose,
devoted himself to the task of proving that the
orders had as yet been allowed no chance to produce
any effect whatever, and that the commercial distress
was due to the recent enforcement of the Berlin Decree.
That much distress existed no one denied;
but its causes might well be matter of dispute; and
Parliament left the merchants to decide the point
as they pleased. Brougham’s inquiry had no other
effect.</p>

<p>Pinkney’s dealings with Canning were equally
fruitless. January 26, when Pinkney received official
news of the embargo, he went instantly to Canning,
“who received my explanations with great apparent
satisfaction, and took occasion to express the most-friendly
disposition toward our country.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Pinkney
used this opportunity to remonstrate against the tax
imposed on American cotton by the Orders in Council.
A week afterward Canning sent for him, and gravely
suggested a friendly arrangement. He wished to
know Pinkney’s private opinion whether the United
States would prefer an absolute interdict to a prohibitory
duty on cotton intended for the continent.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
The sting of this inquiry rested not so much in the
alternative thus presented as in the seriousness with
which Canning insisted that his overture was a
concession to America. With all his wit, as Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
Castlereagh soon had reason to learn, Canning could
not quite acquire tact or understand the insults he
offered. Pinkney tried, with much good temper, to
make him aware that his offer was in bad taste;
but nothing could stop him in the path of conciliation,
and February 22 he addressed to Pinkney a
note announcing that the British government meant
to prohibit the export of American cotton to the
continent of Europe.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I flatter myself,” he continued,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> “that this alteration
in the legislative regulations by which the Orders of
Council are intended to be carried into execution, will be
considered by you as a satisfactory evidence of the disposition
of his Majesty’s government to consult the
feelings as well as the interests of the United States in
any manner which may not impair the effect of that
measure of commercial restriction to which the necessity
of repelling the injustice of his enemies has compelled
his Majesty reluctantly to have recourse.”</p>
</div>

<p>“One object of all this is certainly to conciliate us,”
wrote Pinkney to Madison.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> On the day of Canning’s
note Spencer Perceval carried out the promise
by moving the House for leave to bring in a bill prohibiting
the export of cotton, except by license. At
the same time he extended the like prohibition to
Jesuit’s bark, or quinine. Impervious to indignation
and ridicule,—caring as little for the laughter of
Sydney Smith as for the wrath of Lord Grenville,—Perceval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
pushed all his measures through Parliament,
and by the middle of April succeeded in riveting his
restrictive system on the statute-book. No power
short of a new political revolution could thenceforward
shake his grasp on American commerce.</p>

<p>Yet Perceval felt and dreaded the effects of the
embargo, which threatened to paralyze the healthiest
industries of England. To escape the effects of this
weapon Perceval would have made every possible
concession short of abandoning his great scheme of
restrictive statesmanship. March 26 he submitted
to his colleagues a paper containing suggestions on
this point.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> “It must be admitted,” he began, “that
it is extremely desirable that America should relax
her embargo at least as far as respects the intercourse
with this country.” The Americans submitted
to it with reluctance, chiefly because they feared
the seizure of their vessels in case England or France
should declare war. To profit by this situation Perceval
proposed a new order, which should guaranty
the safety of every merchant-vessel, neutral or belligerent,
on a voyage to or from a British port. The
advantages of this step were political as well as commercial.
The British ministry was disposed to meet
the wishes of the Boston Federalists. Such an order,
Perceval said, “would have the appearance of a
friendly act on the part of this government toward
America, and would increase the embarrassment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
difficulties of that government in prevailing upon their
subjects to submit to the embargo.”</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst approved the suggestion; Lord
Castlereagh opposed it, for reasons best given in his
own words:<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the only object to be aimed at in conducting ourselves
toward America was to force the abrogation of the
embargo, I agree with Mr. Perceval that the proposed
measure would make it more difficult for the American
government to sustain it; but in yielding so far to the
popular feeling the governing party would still retain
much of their credit, and they would continue to act on
all the unsettled questions between the two countries in
their past spirit of hostility to Great Britain and partiality
to France. I think it better to leave them with
the full measure of their own difficulties to lower and
degrade them in the estimation of the American people.
The continuance of the embargo for some time is the
best chance of their being destroyed <i>as a party</i>; and I
should prefer exposing them to the disgrace of rescinding
their own measure at the demand of their own people
than furnish them with any creditable pretext for doing so.
I look upon the embargo as operating at present more
forcibly in our favor than any measure of hostility we
could call forth were war actually declared, and doubt
the policy of exhibiting too great an impatience on our
part of its continuance, which so strong a departure from
our usual practice toward neutrals would indicate.”</p>
</div>

<p>Secretary Canning wrote to his colleague in accord
with Castlereagh’s views.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is so plain upon the face of this measure,” began
Canning, “that however comprehensive it may be made
in words, it <i>in fact</i> refers to America <i>only</i>; and the embargo
in America seems to be working so well for us,
without our interference, that on that ground alone I
confess I could wish that no new steps should be taken,
at least till we have more certain information of the real
issue of the present crisis in America. I have no apprehension
whatever of a war with the United States....
Above all things I feel that <i>to do nothing now</i>, at this
precise moment,—absolutely nothing,—is the wisest,
safest, and most manful policy. The battle about the
Orders in Council is just fought. They are established
as a system. We have reason to hope that they are
working much to good, and very little to mischief.
Every day may be expected to bring additional proofs of
this. But whether this be true to the extent that we
hope or no, their effects, whatever they are, have been
produced in America. Nothing that we now do can
alter those effects; but an attempt to do something will
perplex the view of them which we shall otherwise have
to present to the country in so short a time, and which
there is so much reason to believe will be highly
satisfactory.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perceval, was less certain than Canning that the
country would feel high satisfaction with the effect
of the orders; and he rejoined by an argument which
overthrew opposition:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The reason which strongly urges me to continue the
circulation of this paper, after having read Mr. Canning’s
paper, in addition to those already stated, is the apprehension
I feel of the want of provision not only for
Sweden, but for the West Indies; and therefore every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
possible facility or encouragement which we could give
to prevail upon the American people either to evade the
embargo by running their produce to the West Indian
Islands, or to compel their government to relax it, would
in my opinion be most wise.”</p>
</div>

<p>The order was accordingly issued. Dated April
11, 1808,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> it directed British naval commanders to
molest no neutral vessel on a voyage to the West
Indies or South America, even though the vessel
should have no regular clearances or papers, and
“notwithstanding the present hostilities, or any future
hostilities that may take place.” No measure of the
British government irritated Madison more keenly
than this. “A more extraordinary experiment,” he
wrote to Pinkney,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> “is perhaps not to be found in the
annals of modern transactions.” Certainly governments
did not commonly invite citizens of friendly
countries to violate their own laws; but one avowed
object of the embargo was to distress the British
people into resisting their government, and news
that the negroes of Jamaica and the artisans of Yorkshire
had broken into acts of lawless violence would
have been grateful to the ears of Jefferson. So distinct
was this object, and so real the danger, that
Perceval asked Parliament<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> to restrict the consumption
of grain in the distilleries in order to countervail
the loss of American wheat and avert a famine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
The price of wheat had risen from thirty-nine to
seventy-two shillings a quarter, and every farmer
hoped for a rise above one hundred shillings, as in
1795 and 1800. Disorders occurred; lives were lost;
the embargo, as a coercive measure, pressed severely
on British society; and Madison, with such a weapon
in his hand, could not require Perceval to perceive
the impropriety of inviting a friendly people to violate
their own laws.</p>

<p>The exact cost of the embargo to England could not
be known. The total value of British exports to
America was supposed to be nearly fifty million dollars;
but the Americans regularly re-exported to the
West Indies merchandise to the value of ten or fifteen
millions. The embargo threw this part of the
trade back into British hands. The true consumption
of the United States hardly exceeded thirty-five
million dollars, and was partially compensated
to England by the gain of freights, the recovery of
seamen, and by smuggling consequent on the embargo.
Napoleon’s decrees must in any case have
greatly reduced the purchasing power of America,
and had in fact already done so. Perhaps twenty-five
million dollars might be a reasonable estimate for the
value of the remaining trade which the embargo
stopped; and if the British manufacturers made a
profit of twenty per cent on this trade, their loss
in profits did not exceed five million dollars for the
year,—a sum not immediately vital to English
interests at a time when the annual expenditure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
reached three hundred and fifty million dollars, and
when, as in 1807, the value of British exports was
reckoned at nearly two hundred million dollars. Indeed,
according to the returns, the exports of 1808 exceeded
those of 1807 by about two millions.</p>

<p>Doubtless the embargo caused suffering. The West
Indian negroes and the artisans of Staffordshire,
Lancashire, and Yorkshire were reduced to the verge
of famine; but the shipowners rejoiced, and the
country-gentleman and farmers were enriched. So
ill balanced had the British people become in the
excitement of their wars and industries that not only
Cobbett but even a man so intelligent as William
Spence undertook to prove<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> that foreign commerce
was not a source of wealth to England, but that her
prosperity and power were derived from her own
resources, and would survive the annihilation of her
foreign trade. James Mill replied<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> at great length to
the eccentricities of Spence and Cobbett, which the
common-sense of England would in ordinary times
have noticed only with a laugh.</p>

<p>The population of England was about ten millions.
Perhaps two millions were engaged in manufactures.
The embargo by raising the price of grain affected
them all, but it bore directly on about one tenth of
them. The average sum expended on account of the
poor was £4,268,000 in 1803 and 1804; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
£5,923,000 in 1811; and in 1813, 1814, and 1815,
when the restrictive system had produced its full
effect, the poor-rates averaged £6,130,000. The increase
was probably due to the disturbance of trade
and was accompanied by a state of society bordering
on chronic disorder.</p>

<p>Probably at least five thousand families of working-men
were reduced to pauperism by the embargo and
the decrees of Napoleon; but these sufferers, who
possessed not a vote among them and had been in no
way party to the acts of either government, were the
only real friends whom Jefferson could hope to find
among the people of England; and his embargo
ground them in the dust in order to fatten the squires
and ship-owners who had devised the Orders in Council.
If the English laborers rioted, they were shot:
if the West Indian slaves could not be fed, they died.
The embargo served only to lower the wages and the
moral standard of the laboring classes throughout the
British empire, and to prove their helplessness.</p>

<p>Each government thus tried to overthrow the other;
but that of England was for the moment the more
successful. The uneducated force of democracy
seemed about to break against the strength of an
aristocratic system. When Parliament rose, July 4,
domestic opposition was silenced, and nothing remained
but to crush the resistance of America,—a
task which all advices from the United States showed
to be easy; while as though to make ministers invulnerable,
Spain suddenly opened her arms to England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
offering new markets that promised boundless
wealth. At this unexpected good fortune England
went well-nigh mad; and the Spanish revolution,
which was in truth a gain to democracy, seemed to
strike Jefferson a mortal blow. During the month
of July, 1808, Canning and his colleagues exulted
over Europe and America alike, looking down on
Jefferson and his embargo with the disgust and
horror which they might have felt for some monster
of iniquity like the famous butcher of the Marrs,
who was to rouse the shudders of England during
these lurid years. According to Canning, Napoleon’s
system was already “broken up into fragments utterly
harmless and contemptible.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> According to
Henry Brougham,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> hardly ten men could be found
in London who did not believe Bonaparte utterly
broken, or think him worth paying one hundred
pounds a year to live in retirement at Ajaccio the
rest of his life. America was still more contemptible,
and equally hated. Early in August, at a great dinner
given at the London Tavern to the Spanish
patriots, Sir Francis Baring, of the house of Baring
Brothers,—a man who for a whole generation had
stood at the head of British merchants,—proposed
as chairman, among the regular toasts, the health of
the President of the United States, and his voice was
instantly drowned in hisses and protests. Jefferson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
thanks to the slanders of Pickering and the Federalists,
stood before England in the attitude of a
foiled cutthroat, at the moment when by his order
the American minister in London came to the British
Foreign Office with a request that the Orders in
Council should be withdrawn.</p>

<p>“That the Orders in Council did not produce the
embargo, that they were not substantially known
in America when the embargo took place,”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> was
the burden of Canning’s and Castlereagh’s constant
charge against the United States government. Canning
was one of six or eight men in the world who
might with truth have said that they knew the orders
to have produced the embargo. He alone could have
proved it by publishing Erskine’s official evidence;<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
but he preferred to support Timothy Pickering and
Barent Gardenier in persuading the world that Jefferson’s
acts were dictated from Paris, and that their
only motive was the assassination of England. “Nor,
sir, do I think,” continued Canning before the whole
House of Commons, “that the Orders in Council
themselves could have produced any irritation in
America.... Since the return of Mr. Rose no communication
has been made by the American government
in the form of complaint, or remonstrance, or
irritation, or of any description whatever.” With
infinite industry the assertions of Pickering and Gardenier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
of John Randolph and of the Boston newspapers
and pamphlets, were reprinted and circulated
in London. “Your modesty would suffer,” wrote
Rose to Pickering,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> “if you were aware of the sensation
produced in this country by the publication
of a letter from a senator of Massachusetts to his
constituents.”</p>

<p>Every American slander against Jefferson was welcomed
in England, until Pinkney asked Madison in
disgust, “Have you prohibited the exportation of all
pamphlets which uphold our rights and honor?”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
The English people could hardly be blamed if they
became almost insane under the malice of these falsehoods,
for no whisper of Iago was more poisonous
than Canning’s innuendoes. Believing Jefferson to
be in secret league with Napoleon, they insisted
that the United States should be punished for the
treason Jefferson had planned. Joseph Marriatt, a
prominent member of Parliament, in a pamphlet<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
published in August, reminded President Jefferson
of the fate of the late Czar Paul. The feeling of society
was so bitter that by tacit agreement America
ceased to be talked about; no one ventured longer to
defend her.</p>

<p>In June Pinkney received instructions, dated April
30,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> authorizing him to offer a withdrawal of the embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
on condition that England should withdraw
the Orders in Council. In the situation of English
feeling such an offer was almost an invitation to insult,
and Pinkney would have gladly left it untouched.
He tried to evade the necessity of putting it in writing;
but Canning was inexorable. From week to
week Pinkney postponed the unpleasant task. Not
until August 23 did he write the note which should
have been written in June. No moment could have
been more unfortunate; for only two days before,
Arthur Wellesley had defeated Junot at Vimieiro;
and August 30 Junot capitulated at Cintra. The
delirium of England was higher than ever before
or since.</p>

<p>September 23 Canning replied.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Beginning with
a refusal to admit the President’s advance, his note
went on to discuss its propriety. “His Majesty,” it
said, “cannot consent to buy off that hostility which
America ought not to have extended to him, at the
expense of a concession made, not to America, but
to France.” Canning was a master of innuendo; and
every sentence of his note hinted that he believed
Jefferson to be a tool of Napoleon; but in one passage
he passed the bounds of official propriety:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Government of the United States is not to be
informed that the Berlin Decree of Nov. 21, 1806, was
the practical commencement of an attempt, not merely
to check or impair the prosperity of Great Britain, but
utterly to annihilate her political existence through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
ruin of her commercial prosperity; that in this attempt
almost all the Powers of the European continent have
been compelled more or less to co-operate; and that the
American embargo, though most assuredly not intended
to that end,—for America can have no real interest in
the subversion of the British power, and her rulers are too
enlightened to act from any impulse against the real interests
of their country,—but by some unfortunate concurrence
of circumstances, without any hostile intention,
the American embargo did come in aid of the ‘blockade
of the European continent’ precisely at the very moment
when if that blockade could have succeeded at all, this
interposition of the American government would most
effectually have contributed to its success.”</p>
</div>

<p>Like his colleague Lord Castlereagh, Canning deliberately
tried to “lower and degrade” the American
government in the eyes of its own people. His
defiance was even more emphatic than his sarcasm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To this universal combination,” he continued, “his
Majesty has opposed a temperate but a determined retaliation
upon the enemy,—trusting that a firm resistance
would defeat this project, but knowing that the smallest
concession would infallibly encourage a perseverance
in it.</p>

<p>“The struggle has been viewed by other Powers not
without an apprehension that it might be fatal to this
country. The British government has not disguised from
itself that the trial of such an experiment might be arduous
and long, though it has never doubted of the final
issue. But if that issue, such as the British government
confidently anticipated, has providentially arrived much
sooner than could even have been hoped; if ‘the blockade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
of the Continent,’ as it has been triumphantly styled
by the enemy, is raised even before it had been well
established; and if that system, of which extent and
continuity were the vital principles, is broken up into
fragments utterly harmless and contemptible,—it is,
nevertheless, important in the highest degree to the reputation
of this country (a reputation which constitutes a
great part of her power), that this disappointment of
the hopes of her enemies should not have been purchased
by any concession; that not a doubt should remain
to distant times of her determination and of her
ability to have continued her resistance; and that no
step which could even mistakenly be construed into concession
should be taken on her part while the smallest
link of the confederacy remains undissolved, or while it
can be a question whether the plan devised for her destruction
has or has not either completely failed or been
unequivocally abandoned.”</p>
</div>

<p>With this sweeping assertion of British power Canning
might well have stopped; but although he had
said more than enough, he was not yet satisfied. His
love of sarcasm dragged him on. He thought proper
to disavow the wish to depress American prosperity,
and his disavowal was couched in terms of condescension
as galling as his irony; but in one paragraph he
concentrated in peculiar force the worst faults of his
character and taste:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His Majesty would not hesitate to contribute, in any
manner in his power, to restore to the commerce of the
United States its wonted activity; and if it were possible
to make any sacrifice for the repeal of the embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
without appearing to deprecate it as a measure of hostility,
he would gladly have facilitated its removal as a
measure of inconvenient restriction upon the American
people.”</p>
</div>

<p>Earl Grey, although he approved of rejecting the
American offer, wrote to Brougham that in this note
Canning had outdone himself.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> No doubt his irony
betrayed too much of the cleverness which had been
so greatly admired by Eton schoolboys; but it served
the true purpose of satire,—it stung to the quick,
and goaded Americans into life-long hatred of England.
Pinkney, whose British sympathies had offered
long resistance to maltreatment, fairly lost his temper
over this note. “Insulting and insidious,” he
called it in his private correspondence with Madison.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
He was the more annoyed because Canning
wrote him an explanatory letter of the same date
which gave a personal sting to the public insult.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
“I feel that it is not such a letter as I could have
persuaded myself to write in similar circumstances,”
he complained.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Pinkney’s abilities were great. In the skirmish
of words in which Canning delighted, Pinkney excelled;
and in his later career at the bar, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
he was the most brilliant leader, and in the Senate,
where he was heard with bated breath, he showed
more than once a readiness to overbear opposition
by methods too nearly resembling those of Canning;
but as a diplomatist he contented himself with preserving
the decorous courtesy which Canning lacked.
He answered the explanatory letter of September 23
with so much skill and force that Canning was
obliged to rejoin; and the rejoinder hardly raised
the British secretary’s reputation.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>With this exchange of notes, the diplomatic discussion
ended for the season; and the packet set
sail for America, bearing to Jefferson the news that
his scheme of peaceable coercion had resulted in a
double failure, which left no alternative but war or
submission.</p>

</div>


<p>Early in August, at the time when public feeling
against the embargo was beginning to turn into personal
hatred of Jefferson, news of the Spanish outbreak
reached America, and put a new weapon into
Federalist hands. The embargo, in its effects upon
Spain and her colonies was a powerful weapon to aid
Napoleon in his assault on Spanish liberty and in his
effort to gain mastery of the ocean. In an instant
England appeared as the champion of human liberty,
and America as an accomplice of despotism. Jefferson,
in his pursuit of Florida, lost what was a thousand
times more valuable to him than territory,—the
moral leadership which belonged to the head of
democracy. The New England Federalists seized
their advantage, and proclaimed themselves the
friends of Spain and freedom. Their press rang with
denunciations of Napoleon, and of Jefferson his tool.
For the first time in many years the Essex Junto
stood forward as champions of popular liberty.</p>

<p>So deeply mired was Jefferson in the ruts of his
Spanish policy and prejudices that he could not at
once understand the revolution which had taken
place. On hearing the earlier reports of Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
resistance his first thought was selfish. “I am glad
to see that Spain is likely to give Bonaparte employment.
<i>Tant mieux pour nous!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> To each member
of his Cabinet he wrote his hopes:<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should England make up with us, while Bonaparte
continues at war with Spain, a moment may occur when
we may without danger of commitment with either France
or England seize to our own limits of Louisiana as of
right, and the residue of the Floridas as reprisals for
spoliations. It is our duty to have an eye to this in
rendezvousing and stationing our new recruits and our
armed vessels, so as to be ready, if Congress authorizes
it, to strike in a moment.”</p>
</div>

<p>The victories at Bailen and Vimieiro, the flight of
Joseph from Madrid, the outburst of English enthusiasm
for Spain, and the loud echo from New England,
in the anxieties of a general election, brought
the President to wider views. October 22 the Cabinet
debated the subject, arriving at a new result,
which Jefferson recorded in his memoranda:<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Unanimously agreed in the sentiments which should
be unauthoritatively expressed by our agents to influential
persons in Cuba and Mexico; to wit: ‘If you remain
under the dominion of the kingdom and family of Spain,
we are contented; but we should be extremely unwilling
to see you pass under the dominion or ascendency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
France or England. In the latter case, should you
choose to declare independence, we cannot now commit
ourselves by saying we would make common cause with
you, but must reserve ourselves to act according to the
then existing circumstances; but in our proceedings we
shall be influenced by friendship to you, by a firm feeling
that our interests are intimately connected, and by
the strongest repugnance to see you under subordination
to either France or England, either politically or
commercially.’”</p>
</div>

<p>No allusion to Florida was made in this outline of
a new policy, and none was needed, for Florida would
obviously fall to the United States. The Spanish
patriots,—who were as little disposed as Don Carlos
IV. and the Prince of Peace to see their empire
dismembered, and who knew as well as Godoy and
Cevallos the motives that controlled the United
States government,—listened with only moderate
confidence to the protests which Jefferson, through
various agents, made at Havana, Mexico, and New
Orleans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The truth is that the patriots of Spain have no
warmer friends than the Administration of the United
States,” began the President’s instructions to his agents;<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
“but it is our duty to say nothing and to do nothing for
or against either. If they succeed, we shall be well
satisfied to see Cuba and Mexico remain in their present
dependence, but very unwilling to see them in that of
France or England, politically or commercially. We consider
their interests and ours as the same, and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
object of both must be to exclude all European influence
from this hemisphere.”</p>
</div>

<p>The patriotic junta at Cadiz, which represented the
empire of Spain, could hardly believe in the warm
friendship which admitted its object of excluding them
from influence over their own colonies. In private,
Jefferson avowed<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> that American interests rather
required the failure of the Spanish insurrection.
“Bonaparte, having Spain at his feet, will look immediately
to the Spanish colonies, and think our
neutrality cheaply purchased by a repeal of the illegal
parts of his decrees, with perhaps the Floridas thrown
into the bargain.” In truth, Jefferson and the Southern
interest cared nothing for Spanish patriotism;
and their indifference was reflected in their press.
The independence of the Spanish colonies was the
chief object of American policy; and the patriots
of Spain had no warmer friends than the Administration
of the United States so far as they helped
and hurried this great catastrophe; but beyond this
purpose Jefferson did not look.</p>

<p>In the Eastern States the Democratic and Southern
indifference toward the terrible struggle raging in
Spain helped to stimulate the anger against Jefferson,
which had already swept many firm Republicans
into sympathy with Federalism. In their minds indifference
to Spain meant submission to Napoleon
and hatred of England; it proved the true motives
which had induced the President to suppress Monroe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
treaty and to impose the Non-importation Act
and the embargo; it called for vehement, universal,
decisive protest. The New England conscience, which
had never submitted to the authority of Jefferson, rose
with an outburst of fervor toward the Spaniards, and
clung more energetically than ever to the cause of
England,—which seemed at last, beyond the possibility
of doubt, to have the sanction of freedom.
Every day made Jefferson’s position less defensible,
and shook the confidence of his friends.</p>

<p>With the sanguine temper which had made him
victorious in so many trials, the President hoped
for another success. He still thought that England
must yield under the grinding deprivations of the
embargo, and he was firm in the intention to exact
his own terms of repeal. Pinkney’s earlier despatches
offered a vague hope that Canning might withdraw
the orders; and at this glimpse of sunshine Jefferson’s
spirits became buoyant.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If they repeal their orders, we must repeal our
embargo; if they make satisfaction for the ‘Chesapeake,’
we must revoke our proclamation, and generalize
its application by a law; if they keep up impressments,
we must adhere to non-intercourse, manufactures, and
a Navigation Act.”<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Canning was not altogether wrong in thinking that
concession by Great Britain would serve only to establish
on a permanent footing the system of peaceable
coercion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>
<p>The first blow to the President’s confidence came
from France. Armstrong’s letters gave no hope
that Napoleon would withdraw or even modify his
decrees.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We must therefore look to England alone,” wrote
Madison September 14,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> “for the chances of disembarrassment,—and
look with the greater solicitude as
it seems probable that nothing but some striking proof
of the success of the embargo can arrest the successful
perversion of it by its enemies, or rather the enemies
of their country.”</p>
</div>

<p>To England, accordingly, the President looked for
some sign of successful coercion,—some proof that
the embargo had been felt, or at least some encouragement
to hold that its continuance might save him
from the impending alternative of submission or war;
and he had not long to wait. The “Hope,” bringing
Canning’s letters of September 23, made so quick
a voyage that Pinkney’s despatches came to hand
October 28, as the President was preparing his
Annual Message to Congress for its special meeting
November 7.</p>

<p>Had Canning chosen the moment when his defiance
should have most effect, he would certainly have
selected the instant when the elections showed that
Jefferson’s authority had reached its limit. Friends
and enemies alike united in telling the President
that his theory of statesmanship had failed, and must
be thrown aside. The rapid decline of his authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
was measured by the private language of representative
men, speaking opinions not meant for popular
effect. In the whole Union no men could be found
more distinctly representative than Wilson Cary
Nicholas, James Monroe, John Marshall, and Rufus
King. Of these, Nicholas was distinguished as being
the President’s warm and sympathetic friend, whose
opinions had more weight, and whose relations with
him were more confidential, than those of any other
person not in the Cabinet; but even Nicholas thought
himself required to prepare the President’s mind for
abandoning his favorite policy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the embargo could be executed,” wrote Nicholas
October 20,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> “and the people would submit to it, I have
no doubt it is our wisest course; but if the complete
execution of it and the support of the people cannot be
counted upon, it will neither answer our purpose nor
will it be practicable to retain it. Upon both these
points I have the strongest doubts.... What the alternative
ought to be, I cannot satisfy myself. I see such
difficulties at every turn that I am disposed to cling to
the embargo as long as there is anything to hope from
it; and I am unwilling to form an opinion until I have
the aid of friends upon whom I rely, and who are more
in the way of information.”</p>
</div>

<p>This admission of helplessness coming from the
oldest Virginian Republicans betrayed the discouragement
of all Jefferson’s truest friends, and accorded
with the language of Monroe, who whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
might be his personal jealousies was still Republican
in spirit. After his return from England, at the
moment when his attitude toward the Administration
was most threatening, both Jefferson and Madison
had made efforts, not without success, to soothe
Monroe’s irritation; and in the month of February
Jefferson had even written to him a letter of friendly
remonstrance, to which Monroe replied, admitting
that he had been “deeply affected” by his recall,
and had freely expressed his feelings. The correspondence,
though long and not unfriendly, failed
to prevent Monroe from appearing as a rival candidate
for the Presidency. One of his warmest supporters
was Joseph H. Nicholson, to whom he wrote,
September 24, a letter which in a different tone
from that of Wilson Cary Nicholas betrayed the
same helplessness of counsel:<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We seem now to be approaching a great crisis.
Such is the state of our affairs, and such the compromitment
of the Administration at home and abroad by its
measures, that it seems likely that it will experience
great difficulty in extricating itself.... We are invited
with great earnestness to give the incumbents all the
support we can,—by which is meant to give them our
votes at the approaching election; but it is not certain
that we could give effectual support to the person in
whose favor it is requested, or that it would be advisable
in any view to yield it. While we remain on independent
ground, and give support where we think it is due,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
we preserve a resource in favor of free government within
the limit of the Republican party. Compromit ourselves
in the sense proposed, and that resource is gone. After
what has passed, it has no right to suppose that we will,
by a voluntary sacrifice, consent to bury ourselves in the
same tomb with it.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Wilson Cary Nicholas and James Monroe stood
in such attitudes toward the Administration, admitting
or proclaiming that its policy had failed,
and that it could command no further confidence,
what could be expected from the Federalists, who
for eight years had foretold the failure? New England
rang with cries for disunion. The Federalist
leaders thought best to disavow treasonable intentions;<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
but they fell with their old bitterness on
the personal character of President Jefferson, and
trampled it deep in the mire. Many of the ablest
and most liberal Federalist leaders had lagged behind
or left the party, but the zealots of Pickering’s
class were stronger than ever. Pickering
bent his energies to the task of proving that Jefferson
was a tool of Napoleon, and that the embargo
was laid in consequence of Napoleon’s command.
The success of this political delusion, both
in England and America, was astounding. Even a
mind so vigorous and a judgment so calm as that
of Chief-Justice Marshall bent under this popular
imposture.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nothing can be more completely demonstrated,” he
wrote to Pickering,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> “than the inefficacy of the embargo;
yet that demonstration seems to be of no avail.
I fear most seriously that the same spirit which so tenaciously
maintains this measure will impel us to a war
with the only power which protects any part of the
civilized world from the despotism of that tyrant with
whom we shall then be arranged. You have shown that
the principle commonly called the Rule of 1756 is of
much earlier date, and I fear have also shown to what
influences the embargo is to be traced.”</p>
</div>

<p>Chief-Justice Marshall had read Canning’s insulting
note of September 23 more than a month before
this letter to Pickering was written; yet the
idea of resenting it seemed not to enter his mind.
Napoleon alone was the terror of Federalism; and
this unreasoning fear exercised upon Marshall’s calm
judgment hardly less power than upon the imagination
of Fisher Ames or the austerity of Timothy
Pickering. Second only to Marshall, Rufus King
was the foremost of Federalists; and the same horror
of France which blinded Marshall, Ames, and
Pickering to the conduct of England led King to
hold the President responsible for Napoleon’s violence.
December 1, 1808, King wrote to Pickering
a long letter containing views which in result differed
little from those of Nicholas and Monroe. The
Berlin Decree, he said, had violated treaty rights:<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How dare then our Government with this document
before them, to affirm and endeavor to impose upon the
country so gross a misstatement as they have done in
reference to this French Decree? The Berlin Decree,
being an infringement of our rights, should have been
resisted, as a similar decree of the Directory was resisted
by the Federalists in 1798. Had we so done, there
would have been no Orders in Council, no embargo, and
probably before this we should have been again in peace
with France.... We are now told that the embargo
must be continued or the country disgraced. Admitting
the alternative, how shameful is it—how criminal rather,
might I say—that the men who have brought the country
to this condition should have the effrontery to make
this declaration! The Administration will be disgraced
by the repeal, and they deserve to be; perhaps they
merit more than disgrace. But will the continuance of
the embargo save the country from disgrace? As to its
effect on France and England, we have sufficient evidence
of its inefficacy. The longer it is continued, the deeper
our disgrace when it is raised. It is earnestly to be
hoped that the Federalists will leave to the Administration
and its supporters all projects by way of substitute
to the embargo. Having plunged the nation into its
present embarrassment, let them bear the whole responsibility
for their measures. The embargo must be
repealed. That simple, unqualified measure must be
adopted. It is high time to discard visionary experiments.
For God’s sake, let the Federalists abstain
from any share in them!”</p>
</div>

<p>King was not only the ablest of the Northern
Federalists, he was also the one who knew England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
best; and yet even he condescended to the excuse or
palliation of England’s conduct, as though Jefferson
could have resisted the Berlin Decree without also
resisting the previous robberies, impressments, and
blockades of Great Britain. So deeply diseased was
American opinion that patriotism vanished, and the
best men in the Union took active part with Lord
Castlereagh and George Canning in lowering and
degrading their own government. Not even Rufus
King could see the selfishness of that Tory reaction
which, without regard to Napoleon’s decrees, swept
Great Britain into collision with the United States,
and from which no act of Jefferson could have saved
American interests. Though King were admitted to
be right in thinking that the system of peaceable
coercion, the “visionary experiments” of President
Jefferson’s statesmanship, the fretfulness of Madison’s
diplomacy, had invited or challenged insult, yet after
these experiments had evidently failed and the failure
was conceded, a modest share of patriotism might
consent that some policy for the future should be
indicated, and that some remnant of national dignity
should be saved. No such sentimental weakness
showed itself in the ranks of Federalism. Jefferson’s
friends and enemies alike foresaw that the
embargo must be repealed; but neither friend nor
enemy could or would suggest a remedy for national
disgrace.</p>

<p>No record remains to show in what temper Jefferson
received the letters of Canning and the warnings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
of Wilson Cary Nicholas. Had he in the course of
his sorely tried political life ever given way to unrestrained
violence of temper, he might fairly have
flamed into passion on reading Canning’s notes; but
he seemed rather to deprecate them,—he made even
an effort to persuade Canning that his innuendoes
were unjust. A long memorandum in his own
handwriting recorded an interview which took place
November 9 between him and Erskine, the British
minister.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I told him I was going out of the Administration,
and therefore might say to him things which I would not
do were I to remain in. I wished to correct an error
which I at first thought his Government above being
led into from newspapers; but I apprehended they had
adopted it. This was the supposed partiality of the
Administration, and particularly myself, in favor of
France and against England. I observed that when
I came into the Administration there was nothing I so
much desired as to be on a footing of intimate friendship
with England; that I knew as long as she was our
friend no enemy could hurt; that I would have sacrificed
much to have effected it, and therefore wished
Mr. King to have continued there as a favorable instrument;
that if there had been an equal disposition on
their part, I thought it might have been effected; for
although the question of impressments was difficult on
their side, and insuperable with us, yet had that been
the sole question we might have shoved along in the
hope of some compromise; ... that he might judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
from the communications now before Congress whether
there had been any partiality to France, to whom he
would see we had never made the proposition to revoke
the embargo immediately, which we did to England;
and, again, that we had remonstrated strongly to them
on the style of M. Champagny’s letter, but had not to
England on that of Canning, equally offensive; that
the letter of Canning now reading to Congress, was
written in the high ropes, and would be stinging to
every American breast.... I told him in the course
of the conversation that this country would never return
to an intercourse with England while those Orders
in Council were in force. In some part of it also I
told him that Mr. Madison (who, it was now pretty
well understood, would be my successor, to which he
assented) had entertained the same cordial wishes as
myself to be on a friendly footing with England.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine reported this conversation to his Government;<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
and his report was worth comparing with
that of Jefferson:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I collected from the general turn of his sentiments
that he would prefer the alternative of embargo for a
certain time, until the Congress should be enabled to
come to some decided resolution as to the steps to be
pursued. By this observation I believe he meant that
he would wish to wait until March next, when the new
Congress would be assembled, and the general sense
of the people of the United States might be taken upon
the state of their affairs.... He took an opportunity
of observing in the course of his conversation that his
Administration had been most wrongfully accused of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
partiality toward France; that for his own part he felt
no scruple, as he was about to retire, to declare that
he had been always highly desirous of an intimate connection
with Great Britain; and that if any temporary
arrangement on the subject of impressment could have
been made, although he never would have consented to
abandon the principle of immunity from impressment
for the citizens of the United States, yet that the two
countries might have shoved along (was his familiar
expression) very well until some definite settlement could
have taken place. He remarked also that these were,
he knew, the sentiments of Mr. Madison, who would
in all probability succeed him in his office. He hinted
also that both had been long jealous of the ambitious
views and tyrannical conduct of Bonaparte.”</p>
</div>

<p>“These declarations,” continued Erskine, “are so
opposite to the general opinion of what their real
sentiments have been that it is very difficult to reconcile
them.” In truth, the footing of intimate friendship
with England so much desired by Jefferson
demanded from England more concessions than she
was yet ready to yield; but nothing could be truer
or more characteristic than the President’s remark
that under his charge the two countries might have
“shoved along very well,” had peace depended only
upon him. In this phrase lay both the defence and
the criticism of his statesmanship.</p>

<p>In any event, nothing could be more certain than
that the time for shoving along at all was past. The
country had come to a stand-still; and some heroic
resolution must be taken. The question pressing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
an answer concerned Jefferson more directly than it
concerned any one else. What did he mean to do?
For eight years, in regard to foreign relations his
will had been law. Except when the Senate, in 1806,
with disastrous results, obliged him to send William
Pinkney to negotiate a treaty with England, Congress
had never crossed the President’s foreign policy by
wilful interference; and when this policy ended in
admitted failure, his dignity and duty required him to
stand by the government, and to take the responsibility
that belonged to him. Yet the impression
which Erskine drew from his words was correct. He
had no other plan than to postpone further action
until after March 4, 1809, when he should retire
from control. With singular frankness he avowed
this wish. After the meeting of Congress, November
7, when doubt and confusion required control, Jefferson
drew himself aside, repeating without a pause the
formula that embargo was the alternative to war.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
“As yet the first seems most to prevail,” he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
a few days after his interview with Erskine; and no
one doubted to which side he leaned, though as if it
were a matter of course that he should quit the
government before his successor was even elected, he
added: “On this occasion I think it is fair to leave
to those who are to act on them the decisions they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
prefer, being to be myself but a spectator. I should
not feel justified in directing measures which those
who are to execute them would disapprove. Our situation
is truly difficult. We have been pressed by the
belligerents to the very wall, and all further retreat
is impracticable.”</p>

<p>Madison and Gallatin did not share Jefferson’s
notion of Executive duties, and they made an effort
to bring the President back to a juster sense of what
was due to himself and to the nation. November 15
Gallatin wrote a friendly letter to Jefferson, urging
him to resume his functions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Both Mr. Madison and myself,” wrote Gallatin,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
“concur in the opinion that considering the temper of
the Legislature it would be eligible to point out to them
some precise and distinct course. As to what that should
be we may not all perfectly agree, and perhaps the
knowledge of the various feelings of the members, and
of the apparent public opinion, may on consideration induce
a revision of our own. I feel myself nearly as undetermined
between enforcing the embargo or war as I
was at our last meeting. But I think that we must, or
rather you must, decide the question absolutely, so that
we may point out a decisive course either way to our
friends. Mr. Madison, being unwell, proposed that I
should call on you, and suggest our wish that we might,
with the other gentlemen, be called by you on that subject.
Should you think that course proper, the sooner
the better.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>
<p>Jefferson’s reply to this request was not recorded,
but he persisted in considering himself as no longer
responsible for the government. Although Madison
could not become even President-elect before the first
Wednesday in December, when the electors were to
give their votes; and although the official declaration
of this vote could not take place before the second
Wednesday in February,—Jefferson insisted that his
functions were merely formal from the moment when
the name of his probable successor was known.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have thought it right,” he wrote December 27,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
“to take no part myself in proposing measures the execution
of which will devolve on my successor. I am
therefore chiefly an unmeddling listener to what others
say. On the same ground, I shall make no new appointments
which can be deferred till the fourth of March,
thinking it fair to leave to my successor to select the
agents for his own Administration. As the moment of
my retirement approaches I become more anxious for its
arrival, and to begin at length to pass what yet remains
to me of life and health in the bosom of my family and
neighbors, and in communication with my friends undisturbed
by political concerns or passions.”</p>
</div>

<p>So freely did he express this longing for escape
that his enemies exulted in it as a fresh proof of their
triumph. Josiah Quincy, his fear of the President
vanishing into contempt,—“a dish of skim-milk
curdling at the head of our nation,”—writing to the
man whom eight years before Jefferson had driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
from the White House, gave an account of the situation
differing only in temper from Jefferson’s description
of himself:<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fear of responsibility and love of popularity are now
master-passions, and regulate all the movements. The
policy is to keep things as they are, and wait for European
events. It is hoped the chapter of accidents may
present something favorable within the remaining three
months; and if it does not, no great convulsion can
happen during that period. The Presidential term will
have expired, and then—away to Monticello, and let the
Devil take the hindmost. I do believe that not a whit
deeper project than this fills the august mind of your
successor.”</p>
</div>

<p>Had Jefferson strictly carried out his doctrine, and
abstained from interference of any kind in the decision
of a future policy, the confusion in Congress
might have been less than it was, and the chance of
agreement might have been greater; but while apparently
refusing to interfere, in effect he exerted his
influence to prevent change; and to prevent a change
of measures was to maintain the embargo. In insisting
that the whole matter should be left to the next
Congress and President, Jefferson resisted the popular
pressure for repeal, embarrassing his successor,
distracting the Legislature, and destroying the remnants
of his own popularity. Especially the Eastern
Democrats, who had reason to believe that in New
England the Union depended on repeal, were exasperated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
to find Jefferson, though declaring neutrality,
yet privately exerting his influence to postpone action
until the meeting of another Congress. Among
the Eastern members was Joseph Story, who had
been elected to succeed Crowninshield, as a Republican,
to represent Salem and Marblehead. Story
took his seat Dec. 20, 1808, and instantly found
himself in opposition to President Jefferson and the
embargo:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I found that as a measure of retaliation the system
had not only failed, but that Mr. Jefferson, from pride
of opinion as well as from that visionary course of speculation
which often misled his judgment, was absolutely
bent upon maintaining it at all hazards. He professed a
firm belief that Great Britain would abandon her Orders
in Council if we persisted in the embargo; and having no
other scheme to offer in case of the failure of this, he
maintained in private conversation the indispensable necessity
of closing the session of Congress without any
attempt to limit the duration of the system.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Josiah Quincy and Joseph Story were comparatively
friendly in their views of Jefferson’s conduct.
The extreme Federalist opinion, represented by
Timothy Pickering, placed the President in a light
far more repulsive.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is scarcely conceivable,” wrote Pickering<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> to
Christopher Gore Jan. 8, 1809, “that Mr. Jefferson
should so obstinately persevere in the odious measure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
the embargo, which he cannot but see has impaired his
popularity and hazards its destruction, if he were not
under secret engagements to the French Emperor,—unless
you can suppose that he would run that hazard and
the ruin of his country, rather than that a measure which
he explicitly recommended should be pronounced unwise....
When we advert to the real character of Mr. Jefferson,
there is no nefarious act of which we may not suppose
him capable. <i>He would rather the United States
should sink, than change the present system of measures.</i>
This is not opinion, but history. I repeat it confidentially
to you until I obtain permission to vouch it on
evidence which I trust I can obtain.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Pickering’s hatred of Jefferson amounted to mania;
but his language showed the influence which, whether
intentionally or not, the President still exerted on the
decisions of Congress. All accounts agreed that
while refusing to act officially, the President resisted
every attempt to change, during his time, the policy
he had established. Canning’s defiance and Napoleon’s
discipline reduced him to silence and helplessness;
but even when prostrate and alone, he clung
to the remnant of his system. Disaster upon disaster,
mortification upon mortification, crowded fast upon
the man whose triumphs had been so brilliant, but
whose last hope was to escape a public censure more
humiliating than any yet inflicted on a President of
the United States. The interest attached to the history
of his administration—an interest at all times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
singularly personal—centred at last upon the single
point of his personality, all eyes fixing themselves
upon the desperate malice with which his ancient
enemies strove to drive him from his cover, and the
painful efforts with which he still sought to escape
their fangs.</p>

</div>


<p>November 8 President Jefferson sent to Congress
his last Annual Message, and with it the correspondence
of Pinkney and Armstrong. Intent as the public
was upon foreign affairs alone, the Message had
no further interest than as it dealt with the question
of embargo; but Jefferson showed that he had lost
none of his old dexterity, for he succeeded in giving
to his words the appearance of conveying no
opinion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Under a continuance of the belligerent measures
which, in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of
neutrals, overspread the ocean with danger, it will rest
with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best
adapted to such a state of things; and bringing with
them as they do from every part of the Union the sentiments
of our constituents, my confidence is strengthened
that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring
regard to the rights and interests of the nation, weigh and
compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice
is to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues
which on other occasions have marked the character of
our fellow-citizens, if I did not cherish an equal confidence
that the alternative chosen, whatever it may be,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism
which the crisis ought to inspire.”</p>
</div>

<p>The favorite assumption that Congress, not the Executive,
directed the national policy served again to
veil Jefferson’s wishes, but in this instance with some
reason; for no one was ignorant that a strong party
in Congress meant if possible to take the decision
out of the President’s hands. Only by the phrase
“painful alternatives” did he hint an opinion, for
every one knew that by this phrase he aimed at
narrowing the choice of Congress between embargo
and war. One other paragraph suggested that his
own choice would favor continued commercial restrictions:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The situation into which we have thus been forced
has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and
capital to internal manufactures and improvements. The
extent of this conversion is daily increasing, and little
doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming
will—under the auspices of cheaper material and
subsistence, the freedom of labor from taxation with
us, and of protecting duties and prohibitions—become
permanent.”</p>
</div>

<p>Not only the Message but also the language, still
more emphatic, of private letters showed that Jefferson
had become a convert to manufactures and
protected industries. “My idea is that we should
encourage home manufactures,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> “to the extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
of our own consumption of everything of which
we raise the raw material.” This avowal did much
to increase the ill-will of New England, where Jefferson’s
hostility to foreign commerce as a New England
interest was believed to be inveterate and deadly;
but the anger of Massachusetts and Connecticut at
the wound thus threatened to their commerce and
shipping could not exceed the perplexity of Southern
Republicans, who remembered that Jefferson in 1801
promised them “a wise and frugal government, which
shall restrain men from injuring one another; which
shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their
own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall
not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has
earned.” Not only manufactures but also internal
improvements were to become a chief object of governmental
regulation to an extent which no Federalist
had ever suggested. The absolute prohibition of
foreign manufactures was to go hand in hand with a
magnificent scheme of public works. In the actual
state of public affairs,—without revenue and on the
verge of war with France and England,—Jefferson
exposed himself to ridicule by alluding to a surplus;
years were to pass before the employment of surplus
revenue was to become a practical question in American
politics, and long before it rose Jefferson had
reverted to his old theories of “a wise and frugal
government;” but in 1808, as President, he welcomed
any diversion which enabled him to avoid the
need of facing the spectre of war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue,”
he said, “whenever the freedom and safety of our
commerce shall be restored, merits the consideration of
Congress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults?
Shall the revenue be reduced? Or shall it not rather
be appropriated to the improvements of roads, canals,
rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity
and union, under the powers which Congress may
already possess, or such amendments of the Constitution
as may be approved by the States?”</p>
</div>

<p>The whole meaning of this paragraph was explained
by other documents. March 2, 1807, the Senate
adopted a Resolution calling upon the President for
a plan of internal improvements. April 4, 1808,
Gallatin made an elaborate Report, which sketched a
great scheme of public works. Canals were to be cut
through Cape Cod, New Jersey, Delaware, and from
Norfolk to Albemarle Sound,—thus creating an internal
water-way nearly the whole length of the coast.
Four great Eastern rivers—the Susquehanna, Potomac,
James, and Santee, or Savannah—were to be
opened to navigation from tide-water to the highest
practicable points, and thence to be connected by
roads with four corresponding Western rivers,—the
Alleghany, Monongahela, Kanawha, and Tennessee,—wherever
permanent navigation could be depended
upon. Other canals were to connect Lake Champlain
and Lake Ontario with the Hudson River; to pass
round Niagara and the falls of the Ohio; and to connect
other important points. A turnpike road was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
be established from Maine to Georgia along the coast.
To carry out these schemes Congress was to pledge
two million dollars of the annual surplus for ten years
in advance; and the twenty millions thus spent might
be partly or wholly replaced by selling to private
corporations the canals and turnpikes as they should
become productive; or the public money might at the
outset be loaned to private corporations for purposes
of construction.</p>

<p>A national university was intended to crown a
scheme so extensive in its scope that no European
monarch, except perhaps the Czar, could have equalled
its scale. Jefferson cherished it as his legacy to
the nation,—the tangible result of his “visionary”
statesmanship. Five years afterward he still spoke
of it as “the fondest wish of his heart,” and declared
that “so enviable a state in prospect for our country
induced me to temporize and to bear with national
wrongs which under no other prospect ought ever to
have been unresented or unresisted.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Even in the
close presence of bankruptcy or war he could not lay
aside his hopes, or abstain from pressing his plan
upon the attention of Congress at the moment when
the last chance of its success had vanished.</p>

<p>The contrast between the President’s sanguine
visions and the reality was made the more striking
by Gallatin’s Annual Report, sent to Congress a few
days later. The President spoke for the Administration
that was passing away, while Gallatin represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
the Administration to come. That the secretary
leaned toward war was notorious, and that he
was Madison’s chief adviser, perhaps to be the head
of his Cabinet, was known or suspected by the men
who stood nearest to the Secretary of State, and who
studied Gallatin’s Report as though it were Madison’s
first Annual Message. The more carefully it was
studied, the more distinctly it took the character of
a War Budget.</p>

<p>Receipts from customs had stopped, but the accrued
revenue of 1807 had brought nearly eighteen million
dollars into the Treasury; and sixteen millions would
remain to supply the wants of Government at the
close of the year 1808. Of this sum the ordinary annual
appropriations would consume thirteen millions.
Starting from this point, Gallatin discussed the financial
effect of the alternatives which lay before Congress.
The first was that of total or partial submission
to the belligerents; “and as, in pursuing that
humble path, means of defence will become unnecessary,—as
there will be no occasion for either an
army or a navy,—it is believed that there would be
no difficulty in reducing the public expenditures to
a rate corresponding with the fragments of impost
which might still be collected.” The second choice
of measures was to continue the embargo without
war; and in this case the government might be supported
for two years with no greater effort than that
of borrowing five million dollars. Finally, Congress
might declare war against one or both of the belligerents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
and in that event Gallatin asked only leave
to contract loans. Persons familiar with the history
of the Republican party, and with the career of its
leaders when in opposition, could not but wonder that
Gallatin should ask leave to create a new funded debt
for purposes of war. To reconcile the inconsistency
Gallatin once more argued that experience proved
debt to be less dangerous than had ten years before
been supposed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The high price of public stocks and indeed of all
species of stocks, the reduction of the public debt, the
unimpaired credit of the general government, and the
large amount of existing bank-stock in the United States
leave no doubt of the practicability of obtaining the
necessary loans on reasonable terms. The geographical
situation of the United States, their history since the
Revolution, and above all present events remove every
apprehension of frequent wars. It may therefore be
confidently expected that a revenue derived solely from
duties on importations, though necessarily impaired by
war, will always be amply sufficient during long intervals
of peace not only to defray current expenses, but also
to reimburse the debt contracted during the few periods
of war. No internal taxes, either direct or indirect, are
therefore contemplated, even in the case of hostilities
carried on against the two great belligerent Powers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such language was an invitation to war. Gallatin
carried courage as far as the President carried caution.
While Jefferson talked of surpluses and deprecated
“painful alternatives,” his Secretary of the
Treasury invited Congress to declare war against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
two greatest Powers in the world, and promised to
support it without imposing a single internal tax.</p>

<p>Madison, upon whose decision even more than on
that of Congress the future policy of the Government
depended, would not express an emphatic opinion.
A glimpse of the chaos that prevailed in the Executive
Department was given in a letter from Macon
to Nicholson,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> written December 4, after Macon had
offered Resolutions in the House looking to a persistence
in the system of embargo and peaceable
coercion:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Gallatin is most decidedly for war, and I think that
the Vice-President [Clinton] and W. C. Nicholas are of
the same opinion. It is said that the President [Jefferson]
gives no opinion as to the measures that ought to
be adopted. It is not known whether he be for war or
peace. It is reported that Mr. Madison is for the plan
which I have submitted, with the addition of high protecting
duties to encourage the manufacturers of the United
States. I am as much against war as Gallatin is in favor
of it. Thus I have continued in Congress till there is
not one of my old fellow-laborers that agrees with me
in opinion.”</p>
</div>

<p>Indecision ruled everywhere at Washington down
to the close of the year. Jefferson would say nothing
at all; Madison would say nothing decisive;<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and
Gallatin struggled in vain to give a show of character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
to the Government. December 29 one of the Massachusetts
representatives wrote to a correspondent the
details of the secretary’s plan:<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Yesterday I spent an hour with Mr. Gallatin, when
he unfolded to me his plan,—a plan which he thinks will
finally prevail. It is this: That we immediately pass a
non-intercourse Act to take effect, say, June 1 next; and
as the bill now reads, that it become null toward that
Power which may relax. Send out the Act forthwith to
England and to France, together with an Act raising
the embargo partially, say, at the same time, and arming,
or granting letters of marque, etc. These being made
known to Great Britain and France, it is expected that
the obstinate Emperor will not alter his course, but it is
expected that Great Britain, when she finds the stand
we deliberately take,—that we have no rebellion; that
Madison and a majority of Democrats are chosen; and
that we shall be fighting a common enemy (France) with
her,—and when she finds that we intend living without
dishonorable purchases of her goods, etc., will study her
interest and relax.”</p>
</div>

<p>The same day Gallatin wrote confidentially to Nicholson,
describing the extreme anxieties he felt:<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Never was I so overwhelmed with public business.
That would be nothing if we went right; but a great confusion
and perplexity reign in Congress. Mr. Madison
is, as I always knew him, slow in taking his ground, but
firm when the storm arises. What I had foreseen has
taken place. A majority will not adhere to the embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
much longer, and if war be not speedily determined on,
submission will soon ensue.”</p>
</div>

<p>Joseph Story two days afterward wrote a more exact
account of the distraction which prevailed at the
White House.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Administration are desirous of peace,” wrote
Story,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> in confidence, December 31. “They believe that
we must suffer much from war; they are satisfied, even
now, that if the embargo could be continued for one year
our rights would be acknowledged were our own citizens
only true to their own interests. They deem this continuance
impracticable, and therefore are of opinion that
after midsummer the plan must be abandoned; and war
will then ensue unless the belligerents abandon their
aggressions.”</p>
</div>

<p>The chaos prevailing in the White House was order
compared with the condition of Congress; and there
again Gallatin was forced to guide. After listening
November 8 to the President’s serene Message, the
House three days later referred the paragraphs concerning
foreign Powers to a committee with G. W.
Campbell at its head. Campbell probably consulted
Madison, and his instance doubtless caused the fruitless
appeal of November 15, through Gallatin, to
Jefferson. Failing to obtain guidance from the President,
Gallatin wrote a Report, which was probably
approved by Madison, and which Campbell presented
November 22 to the House. For clearness and calmness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
of statement this paper, famous in its day as
“Campbell’s Report,”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> has never been surpassed in
the political literature of the United States; but the
rigorous logic of its conclusions terrified men who
could not refute and would not accept them:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What course ought the United States to pursue?
Your committee can perceive no other alternative but
abject and degrading submission, war with both nations,
or a continuance and enforcement of the present suspension
of commerce.</p>

<p>“The first cannot require any discussion; but the pressure
of the embargo, so sensibly felt, and the calamities
inseparable from a state of war, naturally create a
wish that some middle course might be discovered which
should avoid the evils of both and not be inconsistent
with national honor and independence. That illusion
must be dissipated; and it is necessary that the people
of the United States should fully understand the situation
in which they are placed.</p>

<p>“There is no other alternative but war with both parties
or a continuance of the present system. For war
with one of the belligerents only would be submission to
the edicts and will of the other; and a repeal, in whole
or in part, of the embargo must necessarily be war or
submission.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Federalists these stern truths were not wholly
unwelcome, since they brought to an issue the whole
policy, domestic and foreign, which for eight years the
Federalist party had never ceased to condemn; but
to Republicans, who were equally responsible with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
the President for the policy which ended in Gallatin’s
alternative, the harshness of the choice was intolerable.
They felt that the embargo must be abandoned;
but they felt still more strongly that the double war
was ruin. In vain Gallatin tried in his Treasury
Report to persuade them that to fight the two nations
was a practicable task. Congress writhed and
rebelled.</p>

<p>Campbell’s report closed by recommending three
Resolutions as common ground on which all parties
could take their stand, whether for war or embargo.
The first declared that the United States could not,
without a sacrifice of their rights, honor, and independence,
submit to the edicts of Great Britain and
France. The second declared the expediency of excluding
from the United States the ships and the
products of all Powers which maintained these edicts
in force. The third recommended immediate preparations
for defence.</p>

<p>The Federalists were eager for attack; and when,
November 28, Campbell called up the first of his
Resolutions for debate, Josiah Quincy fell upon it with
violence not easily forgotten, and doubtless meant to
strengthen the general belief that New England would
control her passions no longer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The course advocated in that Report is in my opinion
loathsome,” he said; “the spirit it breathes disgraceful;
the temper it is likely to inspire neither calculated
to regain the rights we have lost, nor to preserve those
which remain to us.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span></p>

<p>Assuming that the Report was made in the interest
of embargo, and that it foreshadowed the permanence
of the anti-commercial system, he met it by threats
of insurrection and civil war, expressed in the same
breath with which they were disavowed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good Heavens! Mr. Chairman, are men mad? Is
this House touched with that insanity which is the never-failing
precursor of the intention of Heaven to destroy?
The people of New England, after eleven months’ deprivation
of the ocean, to be commanded still longer to
abandon it! for an undefined period to hold their unalienable
rights at the tenure of the will of Britain
or of Bonaparte!... I am lost in astonishment, Mr.
Chairman. I have not words to express the matchless
absurdity of this attempt. I have no tongue to express
the swift and headlong destruction which a blind perseverance
in such a system must bring upon this nation....
This embargo must be repealed. You cannot enforce
it for any important period of time longer. When
I speak of your inability to enforce this law, let not
gentlemen misunderstand me. I mean not to intimate
insurrection or open defiance of them; although it is impossible
to foresee in what acts that oppression will
finally terminate which, we are told, makes wise men
mad.” Nature gave the ocean to New England, “and
among a people thus situated, thus educated, thus numerous,
laws prohibiting them from the exercise of their
natural rights will have a binding effect not one moment
longer than the public sentiment supports them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Always assuming that the talk of war covered the
plan of retaining the embargo, Quincy allowed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
to encourage warlike ideas much more recklessly
than suited some of his party friends. He ventured
to goad the majority toward a decision which of all
possible results was most disliked by the Federalists
of New England:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Take no counsel of fears. Your strength will increase
with the trial, and prove greater than you are now
aware. But I shall be told this may lead to war. I ask,
Are we now at peace? Certainly not, unless retiring
from insult be peace, unless shrinking under the lash be
peace. The surest way to prevent war is not to fear it.
The idea that nothing on earth is so dreadful as war is
inculcated too studiously among us. Disgrace is worse.
Abandonment of essential rights is worse.”</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever Quincy might have been willing to accept,
the party to which he belonged wanted no war
except with France, while the Republicans were
opposed to war in any shape. John Randolph did
indeed hint at the use of force, but Randolph’s
opinion was never for two days the same. Philip
Barton Key of Maryland, as vehement a Federalist
as Quincy, also advised a policy which could lead
only to war:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I would let our vessels go out armed for resistance,
and if they were interfered with I would make the <i>dernier</i>
appeal. We are able and willing to resist; and when the
moment arrives, there will be but one heart and one hand
throughout the Union.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sentiment was patriotic; but as though expressly
to prove how little it could be trusted, Barent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
Gardenier rose to say, in emphatic and unqualified
terms, that England was wholly in the right, and that
from the first the American government had aimed
at provoking war.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Gardenier’s views were those of
a majority of Federalists, and in the end were adopted
by the party. Quincy’s blindness to the serious danger
of war cost him the confidence of more cautious
conservatives.</p>

<p>On the opposite side, the Republicans seemed for
the most part fairly cowed by the vigor with which
the Federalists defied the embargo and war at once.
Nothing in American history offered a more interesting
illustration of the first stage of the national character
than the open avowals by Congress in 1808 of
motives closely akin to fear. America as a nation
could run no serious military peril, even though she
declared war on England and France at once. The
worst military disaster that could happen would be
a bombardment or temporary occupation of some
seaboard city; the most terrible punishment within
the range of possibility was the burning of a few
small wooden towns which could be rebuilt in three
months, and whose destruction implied no necessary
loss of life. Neither England nor France had armies
to spare for permanent conquest in America; but
so thoroughly had the theory of peaceable coercion
taken possession of the national character that men
of courage appealed to motives such as in a private
dispute they would have thought degrading.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The gentleman talked of resistance, and resistance on
sea,” said Willis Alston of North Carolina, in reply to
Quincy.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> “Did any one believe that he seriously meant
meeting the powerful navy of Great Britain on the sea,—of
that Britain who had been emphatically styled ‘the
mistress of the ocean,’ and who was ‘fighting for the liberties
of the world and of mankind’? No, sir; nothing
of the kind is meant. Submission to her orders would be
the inevitable consequence of the gentleman’s resistance,
and finally a loss of everything dear to the American
character,—a loss of our liberty and independence as
a free people.”</p>
</div>

<p>As though one such admission were not enough,
Alston obstinately recurred to it. “An idea of that
sort of resistance is too idle to merit serious consideration.”
That Willis Alston was a man of no great
distinction might be true; but such expressions were
not confined to him. Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky,
as brave a man as lived, could not face the
idea of war:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the most alarming crisis that ever convulsed the
political world, when empires and kingdoms have changed
with the season, and America, buffeted on every side, has
maintained the ground of perfect neutrality, this nation
should make a pause on this high eminence before they
plunge into the dread conflict.”</p>
</div>

<p>A nation which had never yet moved a muscle
could hardly “make a pause;” but even if Colonel
Johnson’s figures had been more correct, the sentiment
was in his mouth unexpected, for in Kentucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
gentlemen “buffeted on every side” were not supposed
to pause. Still more remarkable was the language of
Troup of Georgia—“the hot-headed Georgian,” as
Jefferson afterward called him, who twenty years
later challenged a civil war, but who in 1808 was
even more anxious than Johnson to pause on the high
eminence where he was buffeted on every side.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Permission to arm,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> “is tantamount to a
declaration of war; and the people of this country want
peace as long as they can preserve it with honor. And
do you think, sir, we are ready to plunge into a ruinous
war, naked and unarmed, to gratify a few bankrupt
commercial speculators? It is easy to declare war; it
is more difficult under present circumstances to maintain
peace; and it is most difficult of all to wage a successful
war. Sir, beware! It is the object of the gentleman
from Massachusetts and his friends to lead you step
by step into a war, and if he can into an unpopular
war, which the moment you cease to conduct with effect
you are ruined, and he and his friends are exalted; ...
and, sir, the moment this party ceases to rule, republicanism
is gone, and with it the hopes of all good men
forever.”</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the picture of American jealousies,
Troup’s remarks offered an interesting example of
the ideas then held in regard to national honor. No
one made the obvious retort that a nation which preserved
peace by tolerating insults like those inflicted
by Champagny and Canning had best say nothing of
its honor. The fiction of pride was still kept up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
though members descended to appeals which seemed
to imply physical fear. Madison’s brother-in-law,
John G. Jackson, admitted himself to be cowed by
Canning’s brutality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fires lighted up in Copenhagen,” said he,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> “are
scarcely extinguished; they are yet glowing before us in
imagination at least. And we ought to recollect that if
we do not submit, it is war; if we do submit, it is tribute;
and if we have war, our towns will share the fate of
fortified Copenhagen, unless we strengthen and fortify
them.”</p>
</div>

<p>On such reasoning, submission and tribute alone
were possible, since fortifications which had failed to
protect Copenhagen were little likely to protect Norfolk
or New York. Macon joined in the same cry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have enough of the necessaries of life to make us
content, and there is no nation in the world at this time
that enjoys more of the luxuries of Europe and of the
East and West Indies than we do,—in a word, none that
enjoys more of the good things of this world.”</p>
</div>

<p>The spectacle of simple and hardy Speaker Macon
in his homespun suit enjoying all the luxuries of
Europe and the farthest East, while Pinkney and
Armstrong paid for them in the spoils of American
merchants, was quaintly humorous; but no one felt
its sting of satire. Even the typical South Carolinian,
David R. Williams,—a man second to none in
courage and independence of character,—wished to
hide behind the embargo for fear of war:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I see no other honorable course in which peace can
be maintained. Take whatever other project has been
hinted at and war inevitably results. While we can procrastinate
the miseries of war, I am for procrastinating.
We thereby gain the additional advantage of waiting the
events in Europe. The true interests of this country can
be found only in peace. Among many other important
considerations, remember that the moment you go to war
you may bid adieu to every prospect of discharging the
national debt.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury had only a month
before officially asserted the contrary; but any excuse
for avoiding war seemed to satisfy the House. From
the beginning to the end of this long and ardent debate
not one member from any quarter of the Union
ventured to say—what every man in the United
States would have said ten years later—that after
the formal and fixed decisions of France and England
war existed in fact and should be declared
in form.</p>

<p>With all John Randolph’s waywardness and extravagance,
he alone shone among this mass of mediocrities,
and like the water-snakes in Coleridge’s
silent ocean his every track was a flash of golden
fire. At moments he struck passionately at his own
favorite companions—at Macon and Williams—as
he struck at Jefferson. The steady decline of public
spirit stung his pride. “It was in that fatal session
of 1805-1806 that the policy of yielding to anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
that might come in the shape of insult and aggression
was commenced. The result was then foretold. It
has happened.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Speaker after speaker revelled in
narrating the long list of insults and outrages which
America had endured in patience.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The House will pardon me,” said Randolph,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> “if I
forbear a minute recapitulation of the wrongs which we
have received not only from the two great belligerents of
Europe, but from the little belligerents also. I cannot,
like Shylock, take a pleasure in saying, ‘On such a day
you called me dog; on such a day you spit upon my
gabardine.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet Randolph himself fell naturally into the habits
at which he sneered; and his wit alone raised him
above the common level of Congressmen. However
happily he might ridicule the timidity and awkwardness
of others, he never advanced a positive opinion
of his own without repudiating it the moment he was
taken at his word. “I would scuffle for commerce,”
he said;<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and the phrase was itself unworthy of a
proud people like the Virginians; but when Campbell
tried to force from him a pledge to stand by the Government
in asserting the national rights, Randolph
declined to gratify him.</p>

<p>Of all the speakers, George Washington Campbell—the
reputed author of the Report—alone took a
tone which might almost be called courageous; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
even Campbell thought more of tactics than of dignity.
He admitted that the object of his Report was
to unite the party on common ground; but he dared
not say whether this common ground was to be embargo
or war; he did not even say—what must have
been in his mind—that the Government had exhausted
alternatives. His chief effort seemed rather
to be directed toward making a dilemma for the
Federalists:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Are they determined to vindicate the rights and independence
of their country? If they are, we wish to know
in what manner. If they are not willing to pursue the
measures of resistance we propose, of a total interdiction
of intercourse with those Powers, will they assume
a higher ground? Will they prefer war? If they do,
this is one of the alternatives presented in the Report.
We wish to know what measures they are willing to
adopt for the safety of the nation. The crisis is awful.
The time has come to unite the people of America.
We join issue with the gentlemen as to a temporizing
policy. We have not,—we will not now temporize.
We say there is no middle course. We are in the first
place for cutting off all intercourse with those Powers
who trample on our rights. If that will not prove
effectual, we say take the last alternative, war, with
all its calamities, rather than submission or national
degradation.”</p>
</div>

<p>The most interesting part of Campbell’s speech was
his awkward admission that peaceable coercion had
failed. Such an admission was equivalent to avowing
that the Republican party had failed, but Campbell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
stumbled as he best could through this mortifying
confession.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We could not foresee,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> “that the Governments
of those Powers would not regard the distress and
sufferings of their own people; that France would suffer
her West Indian colonies to be almost desolated with
famine, and to be compelled to apply to their inveterate
enemy to save them from actual starvation rather than
revoke her decrees; nor could we know that the Government
of Great Britain would be regardless of the complaints
and representations of her manufacturers and a
respectable portion of her merchants; that it would lend
a deaf ear to the hungry cries of the starving mechanics,
and silence their just and loud complaints with the thunder
of their murdering guns, and quench their hunger
with a shower of balls instead of bread. We cannot be
culpable for not anticipating such events.”</p>
</div>

<p>Yet for twenty years the Federalists had wearied
the country with prophecies of these disappointments
which Campbell and his Republican friends said they
could not be expected to foresee. Jefferson had persisted
in acting on the theory that he could enforce
national rights by peaceable means; had staked his
reputation, after long and varied experience, on the
soundness of this doctrine which his political opponents
denied; and suddenly, on its failure, his followers
pleaded that they could not be held culpable for
failing to anticipate what their political opponents had
steadily foretold. The confession of such an oversight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
was more fatal than all the sneers of Randolph
and the taunts of Quincy.</p>

<p>There Congress for the moment stopped. The
debate—which began November 28 and lasted till
December 17—ended in the adoption of Campbell’s
first Resolution by a vote of one hundred and eighteen
to two; of the second by eighty-four to thirty; and
of the third without opposition. Nothing was decided;
and the year closed leaving Congress, as Gallatin
told his friend Nicholson, in “great confusion
and perplexity.”</p>

</div>


<p>Behind the scenes diplomacy was at work, actively
seeking to disentangle or to embroil the plot of the
culminating drama. Erskine, the British minister,
sympathizing with his father Lord Erskine, in good-will
to America, hurried from one to another of the
officials at Washington, trying to penetrate their
thoughts,—an easy task,—and to find a bond of
union between them and George Canning,—a problem
as difficult as any that ever diplomacy solved.
Besides his interview with Jefferson, he reported
conversations with the Cabinet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have had several interviews with Mr. Madison
since the arrival of the ‘Hope,’” he wrote November 5,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
“and have often turned the conversation upon the points
above mentioned, which he did not seem willing to discuss;
but I could collect from what he did say that it
was his own opinion that all intercourse ought to be
broken off with the belligerents, and that some steps
further—to use his expression—ought to be taken....
I will just communicate to you the hints which were
thrown out by Mr. Smith, Secretary of the Navy, in a
conversation which I had with him,—of an unofficial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
kind, indeed, but in which he expressed his sentiments
unequivocally,—that in addition to the steps alluded to
by Mr. Madison, he would wish that their ministers
should be recalled from England and France, and that
preparations should be immediately made for a state of
hostility. Mr. Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury,
would have preferred taking a decided part against one
or other of those Powers before the embargo was first
laid, but thinks that no other course can now be adopted.
The Vice-President, Mr. Clinton, was and is strongly
averse to the embargo system; and though he does not
openly declare himself, it is well known that he is entirely
opposed to the present Administration.... Indeed, in
conversation with me yesterday he inveighed with great
force against the conduct of Bonaparte toward Spain,
and expressed his astonishment that any American should
have <i>hesitated</i> to express such sentiments. He alluded
to the conduct of this Government in not only withholding
any approbation of the noble efforts of the Spaniards
to resist that usurper’s tyranny over them, but to
the language held by their newspapers, and in private by
themselves, of regret at these events as being likely to
conduce to the interest and success of England. A different
tone is now assumed upon that important subject;
and the President said to me a few days ago that however
he might doubt the eventual success of the Spanish
cause, the feelings of a <i>tiger</i> could alone lead to an attempt
to subjugate them through such torrents of blood
and such devastation as must ensue if followed by
success.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine’s report was nearly exact. In regard to
Robert Smith, it was confirmed by a letter written at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
the same moment by Smith to the President;<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and
so far as concerned Madison, Gallatin, and George
Clinton, it was not far wrong. A month then
passed while Congress drifted toward a decision. At
last, about December 1, Erskine roused himself to an
effort. Doubtless Madison and Gallatin knew his
purpose,—perhaps they inspired it; but in any
case, Erskine acted rather in their interests than in
the spirit or policy of Canning.</p>

<p>December 3 the British minister wrote to his Government
the first of a series of despatches calculated
to bring Canning to his senses.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Government and party in power,” said he,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
“unequivocally express their resolution not to remove
the embargo, except by substituting war measures against
both belligerents, unless either or both should relax their
restrictions upon neutral commerce.”</p>
</div>

<p>To reinforce this assertion Erskine reported an
interview with Secretary Madison, who after reviewing
the facts had ended by explicitly threatening a
declaration of war. He said in substance—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That as the world must be convinced that America
had in vain taken all the means in her power to obtain
from Great Britain and France a just attention to their
rights as a neutral Power by representations and remonstrances,
that she would be fully justified in having recourse
to hostilities with either belligerent, and that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
only hesitated to do so from the difficulty of contending
with both; but that she must be driven even to endeavor
to maintain her rights against the two greatest Powers
in the world, unless either of them should relax their
restrictions upon neutral commerce,—in which case the
United States would side with that Power against the
other which might continue the aggression. Mr. Madison
observed to me that it must be evident that the United
States would enter upon measures of hostility with great
reluctance, as he acknowledged that they are not at all
prepared for war, much less with a Power so irresistibly
strong as Great Britain; and that nothing would be
thought to be too great a sacrifice to the preservation of
peace, except their independence and their honor. He
said that he did not believe that any Americans would be
found willing to submit to (what he termed) the encroachments
upon the liberty and the rights of the United
States by the belligerents; and therefore the alternatives
were, Embargo or War. He confessed that the people
of this country were beginning to think the former alternative
too passive, and would perhaps soon prefer the
latter, as even less injurious to the interests, and more
congenial with the spirit, of a free people.”</p>
</div>

<p>In support of Madison’s views Erskine reported
December 4<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> a long conversation with Gallatin, which
connected the action of Congress with the action of
diplomacy. Gallatin and Robert Smith, according
to the British minister, had not approved the embargo
as a measure of defence, “and had thought
that it had been better to have resorted to measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
of a more decided nature at first; but that now they
had no other means left but to continue it for a short
time longer, and then in the event of no change
taking place in the conduct of the belligerents toward
the United States, to endeavor to assert their
rights against both Powers.” Gallatin—acting as
Madison’s Secretary of State—sketched an ingenious
and plausible project which Erskine was to
suggest for Canning’s use. His leading idea was
simple. The total non-intercourse with both belligerents—the
measure recommended by Campbell’s
Report, and about to become law—must remove
two causes of dispute with England; for this non-intercourse
superseded the President’s “Chesapeake”
proclamation and the Non-importation Act of April,
1806, against British manufactures. Henceforward
England could not complain of American partiality
to France, seeing that America impartially prohibited
every kind of intercourse with both countries. This
mode of conciliation was but a fair return for Canning’s
conciliatory prohibition of American cotton,
and if carried one step further must end on both
sides in a declaration of war in order to prove their
wish for peace; but Canning could hardly object to
his own style of reasoning. After thus evading two
English grievances, Gallatin arrived at his third point,—that
Congress meant to interdict the employment
of foreign seamen on American vessels, and thus
put an end to all occasion for impressment. Finally,
Erskine represented Gallatin as saying that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
United States were ready to concede the Rule of
1756, and not to claim in time of war a trade prohibited
in time of peace.</p>

<p>In the ease of private and friendly conversation
the most cautious of men, even more than the most
reckless, stood at the mercy of reporters. Gallatin
was by temperament excessively cautious, and was
evidently on his guard in talking with Erskine; but
he could not prevent Erskine from misunderstanding
his words, and still less from misconstruing his
reserve. The British minister afterward officially
explained that the Secretary of the Treasury had
offered no such concession as was implied by the
Rule of 1756; he proposed only to yield the American
claim, never yet seriously pressed, to the direct
trade between the colonies of France and their
mother country;<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> but although Erskine’s mistake on
this point proved troublesome, it was not so embarrassing
to Gallatin as the inference which the British
minister drew from his reserve on a point of merely
personal interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have no doubt,” continued Erskine, “but these
communications were made with a sincere desire that
they might produce the effect of conciliation; because it
is well known that Mr. Gallatin has long thought that
the restrictive and jealous system of non-import laws,
extra duties, and other modes of checking a free trade
with Great Britain has been erroneous and highly injurious
to the interests of America. He informed me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
distinctly that he had always entertained that opinion,
and that he had uniformly endeavored to persuade the
President to place the conduct of Great Britain and
France in a fair light before the public. He seemed to
check himself at the moment he was speaking upon that
subject, and I could not get him to express himself more
distinctly; but I could clearly collect from his manner,
and from some slight insinuations, that he thought the
President had acted with partiality toward France; for
he turned the conversation immediately upon the character
of Mr. Madison, and said that he could not be accused
of having such a bias toward France, and remarked
that Mr. Madison was known to be an admirer
of the British Constitution, to be generally well disposed
toward the nation, and to be entirely free from any
enmity to its general prosperity. He appealed to me
whether I had not observed that he frequently spoke with
approbation of its institutions, its energy, and spirit,
and that he was thoroughly well versed in its history,
literature, and arts. These observations he made at that
time for the purpose of contrasting the sentiments of Mr.
Madison with those of the President, as he knew that I
must have observed that Mr. Jefferson never spoke with
approbation of anything that was British, and always
took up French topics in his conversation, and always
praised the people and country of France, and never
lost an opportunity of showing his dislike to Great
Britain.”</p>
</div>

<p>When in course of time this despatch was printed,
Gallatin felt himself obliged to make a public disavowal
of Erskine’s statements. That he had at
first preferred measures more decided than the embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
was, he said, a mistake; and the inferences
drawn in regard to President Jefferson were wholly
erroneous:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Eight years of the most intimate intercourse, during
which not an act, nor hardly a thought, respecting the
foreign relations of America was concealed, enable me
confidently to say that Mr. Jefferson never had in that
respect any other object in view but the protection of
the rights of the United States against every foreign aggression
or injury, from whatever nation it proceeded,
and has in every instance observed toward all the belligerents
the most strict justice and the most scrupulous
impartiality.”<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This denial was hardly necessary. The despatches
themselves plainly showed that Erskine, having set
his heart on effecting a treaty, used every argument
that could have weight with Englishmen, and dwelt
particularly upon the point—which he well knew to
be a dogma of British politics—that President Jefferson
had French sympathies, whereas Madison’s sympathies
were English. If Erskine had been a Tory,
he would have known better than to suppose that
Perceval’s acts were in any way due to Jefferson or
his prejudices; but the British minister wished to
employ all the arguments that could aid his purpose;
and to do him justice, he used without stint that
argument which his British instincts told him would
be most convincing,—the single word, War.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I ascertained from Mr. Madison,” he wrote November
26,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> “that ... the Report of the Committee seemed
distinctly to announce that the <span class="allsmcap">ULTIMATE</span> and only effectual
mode of resisting the aggressions of the belligerents
would be by a <i>war</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Canning could be panic-struck by italics and
capital letters, Erskine meant to excite his worst
alarms. Perhaps Madison was a little the accomplice
of these tactics; for at the moment when he
threatened war in language the most menacing, the
future President was trembling lest Congress should
abjectly submit to British orders. Erskine’s despatches
early in December echoed the official words
of Madison, Gallatin, and Robert Smith, but gave
little idea of their difficulties. The same tactics
marked his next letters. Jan. 1, 1809, he wrote to
Canning<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> that the bill which was to carry into effect
the Resolutions of Campbell’s Report had been laid
before the House:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You will observe, sir, that the provisions of this bill
are exactly such as this Government informed me would
be adopted, and which I detailed to you in my despatches
by the last month’s packet. On these measures, and a
strict enforcement of the embargo, the Government and
Congress have determined to rely for a short time, in the
hope that some events in Europe may take place to
enable them to extricate themselves from their present
highly embarrassing situation. It is now universally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
acknowledged that the Embargo Act must be raised by
next summer; and nearly all the members of the ruling
party declare that unless the belligerent Powers should
remove their restrictions upon neutral commerce before
that time, it will be incumbent upon the United States
to adopt measures of hostility toward such of those
Powers as may continue their aggressions.”</p>
</div>

<p>War was the incessant burden of Erskine’s reports;
and he spared no pains to convince his Government
that Madison had both the power and the will to
fight. The next House, he reported, would contain
ninety-five Republicans to forty-seven Federalists:
“This great majority (which may vary a few votes)
would of course be strong enough to carry any measures
they wished; and all their declarations and
their whole conduct indicate a determination to adopt
the line of conduct which I have before pointed out.”
Only three days earlier Gallatin had privately written
to Nicholson that great confusion and perplexity
reigned in Congress, that Madison was slow in taking
his ground, and that if war were not speedily
determined submission would soon ensue; but Erskine
reported little of this pacific temper, while he
sent cry after cry of alarm to London. Toward the
end of December Congress took up a measure for
raising fifty thousand troops. Erskine asked the
Secretary of State for what purpose so large a force
was needed; and Madison replied that the force was
no greater than the state of relations with foreign
Powers required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He added (to my great surprise) that if the United
States thought proper, they might act as if war had been
declared by any or all of them, and at any rate by Great
Britain and France. When I pressed him for a further
explanation of his meaning, he said that such had been
the conduct of both those Powers toward the United
States that they would be justified in proceeding to immediate
hostilities. From his manner as well as from his
conversation, I could perceive that he was greatly incensed;
and it appeared to me that he wished that Great
Britain might take offence at the conduct of the United
States and commence hostilities upon them, so as to give
this Government a strong ground of appeal to the people
of this country to support them in a war,—unless indeed
they could be extricated from their difficulties by
Great Britain giving way and withdrawing her Orders
in Council.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Following one letter by another, in these varied
tones of menace, Erskine ended by sending, Jan. 3,
1809, a Message from the President-elect which
wanted nothing except a vote of Congress to make
it a formal announcement of war:<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the honor to inform you that I had an interview
with Mr. Madison yesterday, in which he declared
that he had no hesitation in assuring me that in the event
of the belligerent nations continuing their restrictions
upon neutral commerce, it was intended by this Government
to recommend to Congress to pass a law to allow
merchant-ships to arm, and also to issue letters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
marque and reprisal. The exact time when this course
would be adopted, he said, might depend upon circumstances
such as could not precisely be described; but he
said that he was confident that if it was not taken before
the expiration of the present Congress, in March, it
would be one of the first measures of the new Congress,
which will be held early in May next.”</p>
</div>

<p>Erskine added that the Federalists also thought
Great Britain wrong in refusing the American offers,
and that they too declared war to be necessary if
these offers should still be rejected. He wrote to Sir
James Craig to be on guard against sudden attack
from the United States. These measures taken, the
British minister at Washington waited the echo of his
alarm-cries, and Madison left the matter in his hands.
No instructions were sent to Pinkney, no impulse
was given to the press; and the public obstinately
refused to believe in war. Perhaps Erskine received
some assurance that no decisive step would be taken
before he should have obtained from London a reply
to his despatches of December; but whether or not he
had any tacit understanding with Madison, his ambition
to reunite the two countries and to effect the
diplomatic triumph of a treaty certainly led him to
exaggerate the warlike ardor of America, and to cross
by a virtuous intrigue what he thought the ruinous
career of his own Government.</p>

<p>On the other hand, General Turreau flattered himself
that the diplomatic triumph would fall not to
Erskine, but to himself; and the hope of war upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
England almost overcame for a sanguine moment his
contempt for American character and courage. Turreau
acquiesced in the embargo, since such was the
Emperor’s will,—but only as a choice of evils; for
he knew better than Napoleon how deep a wound
the embargo inflicted on Martinique and Guadeloupe.
He consoled himself only by the hope that it injured
Great Britain still more. “I have always considered,”
he said,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> “that the embargo, rigorously executed, hurt
us less than it hurt England, because our colonial
interests are of small account in the balance against
the colonial interests of the enemy.” In his eyes a
declaration of war against France was better suited
than the embargo to French interests, provided it
were joined with a like declaration against England;
and he prepared his Government in advance for
treating such a war as though it were an alliance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe that France ought not to take this declaration
in its literal sense, because its apparent object would
be only nominal, and not in the intention of the legislators.
I know that such is now their disposition; and
although it is conceded that the number of Federalists
will be greater in the next Congress than in this, yet the
Administration will always have a great majority in the
House, and a still greater in the Senate. I am in such
close relations with the greater number of senators as not
to be deceived in regard to their intentions. But in this
case, too, it would be necessary that France should not
answer the challenge of war, and should wait until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
first hostilities had taken place between England and
the United States. Then I shall hope that the declaration
against France will be immediately withdrawn. I
have reason to believe that a declaration of war against
France as well as against England will take place only
with the intention of reaching this last Power without too
much shocking public opinion, and in order to avoid the
reproach of too much partiality toward the first. Your
Excellency can, from this, form an idea of the weakness
of Congress, and of the disposition of the American
people.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This despatch, written in the middle of January,
completed the diplomatic manœuvres by which Madison
hoped to unite his foreign with his domestic
policy. The scheme was ingenious. Even if it
should fail to wring concessions from Canning, hostilities
would result only in a cheap warfare on the
ocean, less wearisome than the embargo,—a war
which, so far as concerned the continent of Europe,
would rather benefit than injure commerce; but a
policy like this, at once bold and delicate, required
the steady support of a vigorous Congress. Neither
Erskine nor Turreau told the full strength of the
difficulties with which Madison and Gallatin struggled
within their own party; or that while the new
Administration was laboring to build up a new policy,
the Federalists had already laid their hands on the
material that the new policy needed for its use.</p>

<p>Whatever might be their differences in other respects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin agreed on
one common point. They held that until some decision
should be reached in regard to peace or war, the
embargo must be maintained and enforced. Neither
the dignity nor the interests of the country permitted
a sudden break with the policy which had been steadily
followed during the eight years of their power.
Abandonment of embargo without war was an act of
submission to England and France which would certainly
destroy whatever national self-respect might
have survived the mortifications of the last three
years; but if the embargo was to be maintained, it
must be enforced, and without new legislation strict
enforcement was impossible. This new legislation
was demanded by Gallatin, in a letter of Nov. 24,
1808, addressed to Senator Giles of the Senate committee.
December 8, Giles introduced a Bill conferring
on Gallatin the “arbitrary” and “dangerous”
powers he asked. The new measure answered Gallatin’s
description. Henceforward coasting-vessels were
to give impossible bonds, to the amount of six times
the value of vessel and cargo, before any cargo could
even be put on board; collectors might refuse permission
to load, even when such bonds were offered,
“whenever in their opinion there is an intention to
violate the embargo;” in suits on the bond, the defence
was to be denied the right to plead capture,
distress, or accident, except under conditions so stringent
as to be practically useless; no ship-owner could
sell a vessel without giving bond, to the amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
three hundred dollars for each ton, that such ship
should not contravene any of the Embargo Acts;
and by Section 9, the whole country was placed under
the arbitrary will of government officials: “The collectors
of all the districts of the United States shall
... take into their custody specie or other articles
of domestic growth, produce, or manufacture ...
when in vessels, carts, wagons, sleighs, or any other
carriage, or in any manner apparently on their way
toward the territory of a foreign nation or the vicinity
thereof, or toward a place whence such articles
are intended to be exported;” and after seizure the
property could be recovered by the owner only on
giving bonds for its transfer to some place “whence,
in the opinion of the collector, there shall not be any
danger of such articles being exported.” The collectors
not only received authority to seize at discretion
all merchandise anywhere in, transit, but were
also declared to be not liable at law for their seizures,
and were to be supported at need by the army, navy,
and militia.</p>

<p>In vain did Giles<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and the other stanch followers of
Jefferson affirm that this bill contained no new principles
of legislation; that it was but an extension of
ordinary customs laws; and that its provisions were
“necessary and proper” for carrying into effect the
great constitutional object,—the embargo. Giles held
so many opinions in the course of his public life that
no Federalist cared to ask what might be his momentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
theory of the Constitution; but whether as a
matter of law he was right or wrong, he could hardly
dispute what Gallatin in private admitted, that the
powers conferred by his Enforcement Act were “most
arbitrary,” “equally dangerous and odious.” The
Senate knew well the nature of the work required
to be done, but twenty senators voted for the passage
of the bill, December 21, while only seven voted in
the negative.</p>

<p>In pressing this measure at a moment so critical,
Gallatin may have been bold, but was certainly not
discreet. If he meant to break down the embargo,
he chose the best means; if he meant to enforce
it, he chose the worst. The Eastern congressmen
made no secret that they hoped to resist the law
by force.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This strong tone was held by many of the Eastern
members in a large company where I was present,” wrote
the British minister to Canning Jan. 1, 1809; “and the
gentlemen who so expressed themselves declared that
they had no hesitation in avowing such opinions, and
said that they would maintain them in their places in
Congress.”</p>
</div>

<p>They were as good as their word, and when the bill
came before the House arguments and threats were
closely intermingled; but the majority listened to
neither, and January 5, in a night session, forced the
bill to its passage by a vote of seventy-one to thirty-two.
January 9 the Enforcement Act received the
signature of President Jefferson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span></p>

<p>Senator Pickering, of Massachusetts, alone profited
by this audacious act of power; and his overwhelming
triumph became every day more imminent, as the
conservative forces of New England arrayed themselves
under his lead. Since the departure of Rose,
in March, he had basked in the sunshine of success
and flattery. Single-handed he had driven John
Quincy Adams from public life, and had won the
State of Massachusetts, for the first time, to the pure
principles of the Essex Junto. That he felt, in his
austere way, the full delight of repaying to the son
the debt which for eight years he had owed to the
father was not to be doubted; but a keener pleasure
came to him from beyond the ocean. If the American
of that day, and especially the New England
Federalist, conceived of any applause as deciding
the success of his career, he thought first of London
and the society of England; although the imagination
could scarcely invent a means by which an American
could win the favor of a British public. This
impossibility Pickering accomplished. His name and
that of John Randolph were as familiar in London
as in Philadelphia; and Rose maintained with him
a correspondence calculated to make him think his
success even greater than it was.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In Professor Adams’s downfall, at which I cannot but
be amused,” wrote Rose from London,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> “I see but the
forerunner of catastrophes of greater mark. This practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
answer of your common constituents to his reply to
you was the best possible. By his retreat he admits his
conviction that you were the fitter representative of the
State legislature. In the conversion of Massachusetts,
I see the augury of all that is of good promise with you.
Let me thank you cordially for your answer to Governor
Sullivan. It was an unintentional kindness on his part
thus to compel you to bring to the public eye the narrative
of a life so interesting, so virtuous, and honorable.
Receive the assurance of how anxiously I hope that
though gratitude is not the virtue of republics, the remaining
years of that life may receive from yours the
tribute of honor and confidence it has so many claims to.
In so wishing, I wish the prosperity of your country.”</p>
</div>

<p>Flattery like this was rare in Pickering’s toilsome
career; and man, almost in the full degree of his antipathy
to demagogy, yearns for the popular regard
he will not seek. Pickering’s ambition to be President
was as evident to George Rose as it had been to
John Adams. “Under the simple appearance of a
bald head and straight hair,” wrote the ex-President,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
“and under professions of profound republicanism,
he conceals an ardent ambition, envious of every superior,
and impatient of obscurity.” That Timothy
Pickering could become President over a Union
which embraced Pennsylvania and Virginia was an
idea so extravagant as to be unsuited even to coarsely
flavored flattery; but that he should be the chief
of a New England Confederation was not an extravagant
thought, and toward a New England Confederation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
events were tending fast. The idea of
combining the Eastern States against the embargo,—which
if carried out put an end to the Union under
the actual Constitution,—belonged peculiarly to Pickering;
and since he first suggested it in his famous
embargo letter, it had won its way until New England
was ripe for the scheme.</p>

<p>One by one, the Federalist leaders gave their adhesion
to the plan. Of all these gentlemen, the most
cautious—or, as his associates thought, the most
timid—was Harrison Gray Otis, President of the
Massachusetts Senate. Never in the full confidence
of the Essex Junto, he was always a favorite orator
in Boston town-meeting, and a leader in Boston society;
but he followed impulses stronger than his own
will, and when he adopted an opinion his party
might feel secure of popular sympathy. Dec. 15,
1808, Otis wrote from Boston to Josiah Quincy at
Washington a letter which enrolled him under Pickering’s
command.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be a great misfortune for us to justify the
obloquy of wishing to promote a separation of the States,
and of being solitary in that pursuit.... On the other
hand, to do nothing will seem to be a flash in the pan,
and our apostate representatives will be justified in the
opinions which they have doubtless inculcated of our
want of union and of nerve. What then shall we do?
In other words, what can Connecticut do? For we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
and will come up to her tone. Is she ready to declare
the embargo and its supplementary chains unconstitutional;
to propose to their State the appointment of
delegates to meet those from the other commercial States,
in convention at Hartford or elsewhere, for the purpose
of providing some mode of relief that may not be inconsistent
with the Union of these States, to which we should
adhere as long as possible? Shall New York be invited
to join; and what shall be the proposed objects of such
a convention?”</p>
</div>

<p>In thus adopting the project of Timothy Pickering
for a New England convention, Otis was not less
careful than Pickering himself to suggest that the
new Union should be consistent with the old one.
American constitutional lawyers never wholly succeeded
in devising any form of secession which might
not coexist with some conceivable form of Union,
such as was recognized by the Declaration of July
4, 1776; but no form of secession ever yet devised
could coexist with the Union as it was settled by the
Constitution of 1789; and the project of a New England
convention, if carried out, dissolved that Union
as effectually as though it had no other object. “No
State shall, without the consent of Congress, ...
enter into an agreement or compact with another
State.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Such was the emphatic interdict of the
Constitution, and its violation must either destroy
the Union or give it new shape. Doubtless the Union
had existed before the Constitution, and might survive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
it; but a convention of the New England States
could not exist under the Union of 1789.</p>

<p>Another Boston Federalist, second to none in
standing, who unlike Otis was implicitly trusted by
the Essex Junto, wrote a letter to Senator Pickering,
dated five days later:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Legislature will convene on January 24,” began
Christopher Gore,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> “and what will be proper for us to
do under the circumstances of our times is doubtful. To
ascertain the most useful course to be pursued on this
occasion fills our minds with deep and anxious solicitude....
By conversing with our friends from the other New
England States you might be able to know in what measures
and to what extent they would be willing to co-operate
with Massachusetts. The opposition, to be
effectual of any change in our rulers, should comprehend
all New England. These men, I fear, are too inflated
with their own popularity to attend to any call short
of this.”</p>
</div>

<p>The action of Massachusetts was to be concerted
with Connecticut; and the leading senator from
Connecticut was Pickering’s very intimate friend,
James Hillhouse, whose amendments to the Constitution,
proposed to the Senate in an elaborate speech
April 12, 1808, were supposed by his enemies to be
meant as the framework for a new confederacy, since
they were obviously inconsistent with the actual
Union. Hillhouse and Pickering stood in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
confidential relations. From their common chamber
in the “Six Buildings” they carried on their joint
campaign against the embargo;<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and with this advantage,
Pickering in due time wrote his reply to
Christopher Gore for the guidance of the Massachusetts
General Court:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“New England must be united in whatever great measure
shall be adopted. During the approaching session
of our Legislature there may be such further advances in
mischief as may distinctly point out the course proper to
be adopted. A convention of delegates from those
States, including Vermont, seems obviously proper and
necessary. Massachusetts and Connecticut can appoint
their delegates with regular authority. In the other
States they must be appointed by county conventions.
A strong and solemn address, stating as concisely as
will consist with perspicuity the evil conduct of our
Administration as manifested in their measures, ought to
be prepared to be laid before our Legislature when they
meet, to be sent forth by their authority, to the people.
But the fast, which I have repeatedly heard mentioned
here, I hope will be postponed till the very crisis of our
affairs, if such a crisis should be suffered to arise. To
proclaim a fast sooner would, I fear, have more the appearance
of management than of religion.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Such action was not to be easily reconciled with
the spirit of the Constitution, but Pickering attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
to show its accord; and in doing so he completed the
revolution which for eight years had been in progress
between the two political parties. He placed himself
on the precise ground taken by Jefferson in the
Kentucky Resolutions of 1798:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pray look into the Constitution, and particularly to
the tenth article of the Amendments. How are the
powers reserved to the States respectively, or to the
people, to be maintained, but by the respective States
judging for themselves, and putting their negative on
the usurpations of the general government.”</p>
</div>

<p>That the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut
meant to take the first step toward a change in the
Federal compact was an open secret at Washington
before the close of the year. As early as December
29 Gallatin wrote to his friend Nicholson a letter of
alarm,<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> which showed that the plan was already
known by the Administration:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I actually want time to give you more details, but I
will only state that it is intended by the Essex Junto to
prevail on the Massachusetts legislature, who meet in two
or three weeks, to call a convention of the five New
England States, to which they will try to add New York;
and that something must be done to anticipate and defeat
that nefarious plan.”</p>

</div>


<p>Among the Federalists were still a few moderate
men who hoped that Jefferson might not be wholly
sold to France, and who were inclined to ask for
some new policy of peace or war before throwing
aside the old one. Pickering’s contempt for such
allies echoed the old feuds of New England, and revived
the root-and-branch politics of the Puritans:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some <i>cautious</i> men here of the Federal party discovered
an inclination to wait patiently till the first of
June the promised repeal of the embargo. God forbid
that such timid counsels should reach the Massachusetts
legislature, or a single member of it! A million of such
men would not save the nation. Defeat the accursed
measure now, and you not only restore commerce, agriculture,
and all sorts of business to activity, but you
save the country from a British war. The power of the
present miserable rulers—I mean their power to do material
mischief—will then be annihilated.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Pickering’s instructions were exactly followed; his
temper infused itself through every New England
town. Once more, a popular delusion approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
frenzy,—a temporary insanity like the witchcraft
and Quaker mania,—took possession of the mind of
Massachusetts, and broke into acute expression.
Not for a full century had the old Puritan prejudice
shown itself in a form so unreasoning and unreasonable;
but although nearly one half the people held
aloof and wondered at the madness of their own
society, the whole history of Massachusetts, a succession
of half-forgotten disputes and rebellions, seemed
to concentrate itself for the last time in a burst
of expiring passions, mingled with hatred of Virginia
and loathing for Jefferson, until the rest of
America, perplexed at paroxysms so eccentric, wondered
whether the spirit of Massachusetts liberty
could ever have been sane. For the moment Timothy
Pickering was its genius.</p>

<p>The decision reached by the Federalists at Washington,
on or about December 21, when the Enforcement
Bill passed the Senate, was quickly known in
Massachusetts, and without further delay the crisis
was begun. Hitherto the tone of remonstrance had
been respectful; under cover of the Enforcement Act
it rapidly became revolutionary. Dec. 27, 1808, a
town-meeting at Bath, in the district of Maine, set
the movement on foot by adopting Resolutions<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> which
called on the general court, at its meeting January
25, to take “immediate steps for relieving the people,
either by themselves alone, or in concert with other
commercial States;” while at the same time the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
town voted “that a committee of safety and correspondence
be appointed, to correspond with committees
of other towns, ... and to watch over the
safety of the people of this town, and to give immediate
alarm so that a regular meeting may be called
whenever any infringement of their rights shall be
committed by any person or persons under color and
pretence of authority derived from any officer of the
United States.” This extravagant measure, evidently
intended to recall the memory of 1776, was quickly
imitated by the town of Gloucester, which, January
12,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> formally approved the Resolutions passed at
Bath, voted an address to the general court, and
appointed a committee of public safety. These first
steps went so far that other towns could not easily
keep pace with them, and were obliged to fall behind.
The scheme of appointing everywhere town-committees
of public safety to organize combined resistance
to the national government, was laid aside, or
fell to the ground; but the town-meetings went on.
In the county of Hampshire, a public meeting of
citizens, January 12,<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> announced “that causes are
continually occurring which tend to produce a most
calamitous event,—a dissolution of the Union;”
and January 20, a meeting at Newburyport, in Senator
Pickering’s County of Essex, voted—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That we will not aid or assist in the execution of the
several embargo laws, especially the last, and that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
consider all those who do as violators of the Constitution
of the United States and of this Commonwealth; and
that they be considered as unworthy of the confidence
and esteem of their fellow-citizens.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the eve of the day fixed for the General Court
to assemble, in the midst of town-meetings far and
near, Boston called a meeting at Faneuil Hall. The
town had grown to a population of more than thirty
thousand, but old citizens could remember the Stamp
Act and the Boston Port Bill; they had seen Samuel
Adams and John Hancock defy, in Faneuil Hall, the
power of Parliament; and the same town-meeting
which had stood firm against King George, even to
the point of armed rebellion, still existed unchanged,
ready to resist the tyranny of a Virginia President.
January 23 four thousand citizens swarmed to the
hall famous for its Revolutionary associations; and
in the minds of all, either as a hope or a terror,
revolution was the absorbing thought.</p>

<p>Socially, nothing could be more respectable than
the assembly. The names of the committee appointed
to draft a petition to the general court included the
best people of Boston. The list began with Thomas
Handasyd Perkins, and included Samuel Dexter,
John Warren, William Sullivan, Jonathan Mason, and
Theodore Lyman,—members of a city aristocracy
which still existed in vigor as robust as in the days
when aristocracy was sustained by English example
and patronage. Chief-Justice Parsons, who freely
expressed his opinion that the embargo was unconstitutional,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
had no part in the proceedings; but on his
privately given advice the meeting was to take its
stand. The Essex Junto, willing to escape its own
unpopularity, surrendered the apparent lead to a man
who shared in few of the extreme opinions of Pickering,
Parsons, and George Cabot,—a man who stood
second to no Federalist in ability, but who had never
sympathized with Alexander Hamilton’s feuds, or
with factious hostility either to Federalist or to Republican
Presidents. Samuel Dexter, Secretary of
War in 1800, Secretary of the Treasury in 1801, a
lawyer of the highest standing, had been employed
to argue against the constitutionality of the Embargo
Act before Judge Davis in September, and although
he lost his cause, he stoutly maintained the soundness
of his argument. In truth, the question was still
open; and since the trial at Salem, the Enforcement
Act had greatly strengthened constitutional objections
already strong. Dexter believed that his duty
required him to join in protesting against such legislation,
and accordingly he took an active part in
drafting and defending the Resolutions and memorial
reported by his committee, which appealed to the
general court “for their interposition to save the
people of this Commonwealth from the destructive
consequences which they apprehend to their liberties
and property from the continuance of the present
system.”</p>

<p>No measure reported by Samuel Dexter was likely
to satisfy the hot temper of a town-meeting. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
regular Resolutions were duly adopted, with little
vigorous opposition, and the meeting adjourned till
the next day; but when the citizens reassembled,
January 24, they passed another resolve, offered by
Daniel Sargent, which startled the law-abiding public
of Massachusetts by formally declaring that “we will
not voluntarily aid or assist in the execution” of the
Enforcement Act; and that “all those who shall so
assist in enforcing upon others the arbitrary and unconstitutional
provisions of this Act, ought to be
considered as enemies to the Constitution of the
United States and of this State, and hostile to the
liberties of this people.”</p>

<p>Alarming as was the tone of Boston, Samuel
Dexter and his associates avoided taking open part
with the British government against their own. Elsewhere
no such reticence was shown. Not only in
private, in all places, at every table, did the bitterness
of New England temper and the intensity of local
prejudice allow themselves the freest expression, but
the numerous town-meetings also showed a spirit
rather British than American. Among many examples
a few are worth recalling, to show the
absence of national feeling, and the difficulties and
dangers which stood in the nation’s way.</p>

<p>January 24 the town of Beverly, in Essex County,
voted<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> that—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They have witnessed with regret too strong a propensity
to palliate and overlook the unjust aggressions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
one foreign nation, and to exaggerate and misrepresent
the conduct of another; that the measures pursued are
calculated and designed to force us into a war with
Great Britain,—a war which would be extremely detrimental
to our agriculture, fatal to our commerce, and
which would probably deprive us forever of the Bank
fishery,—and to unite us in alliance with France, whose
embrace is death.”</p>
</div>

<p>January 26 the town of Plymouth voted<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That by the partial and insidious management of
our external relations, by a servile compliance with the
views of one belligerent whose restless ambition is grasping
at the subjugation of the civilized world, and by the
unnecessary provocations offered to another, magnanimously
contending for its own existence and the emancipation
of the oppressed, our national peace is endangered,
and our national dignity and good faith sacrificed on the
altar of duplicity.”</p>
</div>

<p>January 23 the town of Wells, in the district of
Maine, voted<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That we deprecate that cringing sycophancy which
has marked the conduct of our national government
toward the tyrant of Europe, while we view with indignation
and alarm its hostility toward Great Britain.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the same day Gloucester spoke in language still
more insulting to the national government:<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We see not only the purse-strings of our nation in
the hands of a Frenchified Genevan, but all our naval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
forces and all our militia placed under the control of this
same foreigner, whom we cannot but think a satellite of
Bonaparte.... In our opinion the national Cabinet
has given to this country and the world the most indubitable
evidence of their insincerity; that their great study
has been to involve this country in a war with Great
Britain, and of course to form a coalition with France,
regardless of consequences. Their pledges to France of
their willingness to submit to the wishes or mandates of
the Corsican have been satisfactory.... We should
deprecate a separation of the States, and would resort to
every honorable means of redress before we would seek
relief in a dissolution of the Union.... Our Administration
can dissemble their real motives no longer; our
dreadful forebodings prove realities; the expected blow
has reached us, and by it has fled our liberty.”</p>
</div>

<p>In quaint and pathetic phrases, the little town of
Alfred, in Maine, sent to the general court a petition<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
which charged the national government with
endeavoring “to provoke a ruinous and destructive
war with England, to gratify the ambition and caprice,
and augment the power, of the tyrant of
France.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are the poor inhabitants of a small town,” continued
the Alfred petition, “rendered poorer by the wayward,
inconsistent policy of the general government;
but life and liberty are as dear to us as to our opulent
brethren of the South, and we flatter ourselves that we
have as much love of liberty and abhorrence of slavery
as those who oppress us in the name of Republicanism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
We love liberty in principle but better in practice. We
cling to a union of the States as the rock of our salvation;
and nothing but a fearful looking for of despotism
would induce us to wish for a severance of the band that
unites us. But oppression did sever us from the British
empire; and what a long and continued repetition of
similar acts of the government of the United States
would effect, God only knows!”</p>
</div>

<p>These extracts showed the temper in which the
Massachusetts legislature met. The Federalist leaders
had more difficulty to restrain than to excite the
people, and felt themselves strong enough to assume
the air of cautious and conservative men. After an
exchange of opinions between the Legislature and
Levi Lincoln, who had become governor on the death
of Sullivan shortly before, both Houses turned their
attention to national affairs. The numerous petitions
on the subject of the embargo were referred to committees.
Without loss of time the Senate committee,
February 1, made a Report recommending an
Act to secure the people of the State from “unreasonable,
arbitrary, and unconstitutional searches in
their dwelling-houses;” to which was added a series
of four Resolutions, closing with a formal adoption of
the step so long desired by Senator Pickering.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Legislature of this Commonwealth
will zealously co-operate with any of the other States in
all legal and constitutional measures for procuring such
amendments to the Constitution of the United States as
shall be judged necessary to obtain protection and defence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
for commerce, and to give to the commercial States
their fair and just consideration in the government of the
Union; and for affording permanent security, as well as
present relief, from the oppressive measures under which
they now suffer.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Honorable the President of the
Senate, and the Honorable the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, be requested to transmit a copy of this
Report, and the Resolutions thereon, to the legislatures
of such of our sister States as manifest a disposition to
concur with us in measures to rescue our common country
from impending ruin, and to preserve inviolate the
union of the States.”</p>
</div>

<p>These Resolutions proclaimed that a union of the
Eastern States against the national government was
the earnest wish of Massachusetts; and the advance
thus made was instantly met by Connecticut, where
Jonathan Trumbull, a Federalist of pure stock, who
had for ten years filled the chair of governor, called
a special meeting of the Legislature in pursuance of
the arrangement concerted at Washington. The
temper of Governor Trumbull could be judged from a
letter written by him, February 4, to Secretary Dearborn,
who had requested him to select militia officers
on whom the collectors might call for military aid in
enforcing the embargo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Conceiving as I do,” replied Governor Trumbull,
“and believing it to be the opinion of the great mass of
citizens of this State, that the late law of Congress for a
more rigorous enforcement of the embargo is unconstitutional
in many of its provisions, interfering with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
State sovereignties, and subversive of the rights, privileges,
and immunities of the citizens of the United
States, ... my mind has been led to a serious and
decided determination to decline a compliance with your
request, and to have no agency in the appointments
which the President has been pleased to refer to me.”</p>
</div>

<p>In calling together the legislature of Connecticut,
Governor Trumbull’s concert with Massachusetts was
evident, and his object of resisting the embargo was
avowed. So bluntly did the Federalists proclaim
their purpose, that when the Connecticut legislature
met, February 23, the governor in his opening speech
explained his action as though it were a matter of
course that he should call upon the State to nullify
an Act of Congress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whenever our national legislature,” he said, “is led
to overleap the prescribed bounds of their constitutional
powers, on the State legislatures in great emergencies
devolves the arduous task,—it is their right, it becomes
their duty,—to interpose their protecting shield between
the rights and liberties of the people and the assumed
power of the general government.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Madison was not by that time weary of his own
words,—if the Resolutions of 1798 and the fatal
“interpose” of Virginia had not become hateful to
his ears,—he might have found some amusement
in the irony with which Trumbull flung the familiar
phrases of Virginia back into her face; but serious
as such conduct was, the mere defiance carried less
alarm than was warranted by the signs of secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
concert with England which the Federalists willingly
betrayed. Trumbull and Hillhouse, Pickering and
Otis, were not necessarily masters of the situation,
even when at the head of all New England; but
when they pointed significantly at the fleets and
armies of Great Britain behind them, they carried
terror to the heart of the Union. So little did they
hide their attitude toward the British government
that their organ, the “New England Palladium,”
published, January 6, Canning’s personal letter of
Sept. 23, 1808, to Pinkney, which Madison had suppressed.
How it had been obtained, no one knew.
The British Foreign Office seemed to stand in direct
communication with Boston, while the Boston
Federalists exulted in a chance to swell what they
thought the triumph of George Canning over their
own Federalist friend, William Pinkney.</p>

<p>Tactics like these, unscrupulous though they might
be, were effective. Jefferson and Madison had the
best reason to know the force of such factiousness,
for only ten years before, on less provocation, they
had themselves led in Virginia and Kentucky a movement
with a similar purpose; but although their
history as leaders of an opposition implied agreement
in principle with the doings of Massachusetts and
Connecticut, their dignity and interest as Presidents
of the United States required them to carry out the
laws they had advised and approved. Whatever
might be the personal wishes of a few men like Pickering,
the great mass of Federalists wished at heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
no more harm to the country than to overthrow and
humiliate Jefferson, and to cripple Madison from the
start; while the Administration, on its side, in struggling
to escape a personal humiliation, was obliged to
adopt any course that offered the best hope of success
even though it should sacrifice the national character.
As the last weeks of President Jefferson’s Administration
approached, this personal conflict—the bitterness
of sixteen years—concentrated its virulence
upon a single point, but that point vital to Jefferson’s
fame and popularity,—the embargo.</p>

<p>Rarely in American history has been seen a struggle
more furious or less ennobling than that which took
place at Washington in the months of January and
February, 1809. With a bold face, but with small
confidence, Madison and Gallatin pressed their measures.
After passing the Enforcement Act on the
morning of January 6, Congress turned at once to
a matter even more serious. January 7 a Resolution
was offered in the House providing for an early
meeting of the next Congress, and in the short debate
that followed, a distinct line began for the first
time to divide the advocates of war from the partisans
of peace. The extra session was avowedly to be
called for the purpose of declaring war. Simultaneously
a bill was introduced to raise, arm, and equip
fifty thousand volunteers to serve for the term of
two years; while the Senate sent down another
bill ordering all the frigates and gunboats to be
“fitted out, officered, manned, and employed as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
as may be.” The fourth Monday in May was the
date proposed for the extra session, and Congress
at last found itself face to face with the naked
issue of war.</p>

<p>The effect of the crisis upon Congress was immediate.
Doubt, defiance, dismay, and disgust took
possession of the Legislature, which swayed backward
and forward from day to day, as courage or fear prevailed.
The old Republicans, who could not yield
their faith in the embargo, begged almost piteously
for delay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A large portion of the people, the South almost
unanimously,” urged David R. Williams of South Carolina,
“have expressed a wish that the Government should
adhere to the embargo till it produces an effect, or the
capacity to produce the effect be disproved. You are
like to be driven out of the embargo by war? Why, sir,
look at the sensation in New England and New York,
and talk about going to war when you cannot maintain
an embargo!... If you do not adopt war before the
fourth Monday in May, will the nation be ruined if you
postpone it still further?”<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Macon declared that the embargo was still the
people’s choice:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As to the people being tired of the embargo, whenever
they want war in preference to it they will send
their petitions here to that effect.... Let each man put
the question to his neighbor whether he will have war or
embargo, and there is no doubt but he will answer in
favor of the latter.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span></p>
<p>Such reasoning, honest and true as it was in the
mouths of men like Macon and Williams, gave a tone
of weakness and irresolution to the debate, while it
acted on the Federalists with the force of defiance,
and drew from Josiah Quincy a speech which long
remained famous, and which no Republican ever forgot
or forgave.</p>

<p>That this strong, self-asserting Boston gentleman,
gifted, ambitious, the embodiment of Massachusetts
traditions and British prejudices, should feel deep
contempt for the moral courage and the understanding
of men whose motives were beyond the range of his
sympathies and experience, was natural; for Josiah
Quincy belonged to a class of Americans who cared
so intensely for their own convictions that they could
not care for a nation which did not represent them;
and in his eyes Jefferson was a transparent fraud, his
followers were dupes or ruffians, and the nation was
hastening to a fatal crisis. Yet with all this to excuse
him, his language still passed the bounds of license.
He began by reaffirming that deception had been
practised on the House when the President induced
it to adopt the embargo without alluding to its coercive
purpose:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not think I state my position too strongly when
I say that not a man in this House deemed the embargo
intended chiefly as a measure of coercion on Great Britain;
that it was to be made permanent at all hazards
until it had effected that object, and that nothing else
effectual was to be done for the support of our maritime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
rights. If any individual was influenced by such
motives, certainly they were not those of a majority of
this House. Now, sir, on my conscience, I do believe
that these were the motives and intentions of the Administration
when they recommended the embargo to the
adoption of this House.”</p>
</div>

<p>So far as concerned President Jefferson this charge
was true; but every one knew that Jefferson habitually
threw responsibility on Congress, and after the
scandal made by John Randolph in the Spanish
affair of 1805, the House alone was to blame if it incurred
consequences which were evident on the face
of its measures. Quincy next asserted a worse and
more mischievous charge:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not only that embargo was resorted to as a means
of coercion, but from the first it was never intended by
the Administration to do anything else effectual for the
support of our maritime rights. Sir, I am sick—sick to
loathing—of this eternal clamor of ‘war, war, war!’
which has been kept up almost incessantly on this floor,
now for more than two years. Sir, if I can help it, the
old women of this country shall not be frightened in this
way any longer. I have been a long time a close observer
of what has been done and said by the majority
of this House, and for one I am satisfied that no insult,
however gross, offered to us by either France or
Great Britain, could force this majority into the declaration
of war. To use a strong but common expression,
it could not be kicked into such a declaration by
either nation.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span></p>
<p>Insults are pointless unless they have a foundation
of truth or probability. The Parliament of Great
Britain would have laughed at such a taunt; Napoleon
would not have understood what it meant; but
Congress drew a deep breath of dismay, for every
member knew that openly and secretly, in public
and in private, the single decisive argument against
war had been and still was—fear. After four years
of outrage such as would have made the blood of an
Englishman or a Frenchman turn to fire in his veins,
not an American could be found, between Canada
and Texas, who avowed the wish to fight. Quincy’s
speech produced a momentary outbreak of passion;
hot retorts were made; the chamber rang with epithets
of abuse; but still no one professed to want
war. The House twisted and turned like a martyr
on his bed of steel, but its torture was of painful
doubt, not of passion.</p>

<p>So far as mere words affected the public mind,
Josiah Quincy’s taunt, not less than the sarcasms
of Canning and the arrogance of Napoleon, stung
Americans beyond endurance. In one sense Quincy
did good service to his country; his statesmanship,
if not refined, was effective; his argument, if somewhat
brutal, was strong; and within four-and-twenty
hours the House met it in the only way that could
preserve the dignity of Congress and the Administration,
by passing the bill for an extra session with
eighty votes against twenty-six. This result was
reached January 20, and seemed to prove that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
Government had overcome its difficulties and mastered
the situation; but nothing was further from
the truth. Quincy knew what was passing behind
the scenes. The Administration, so far from gaining
strength, barely showed steadiness. At the moment
when New England flung herself, with every sign of
desperate rage, across the path of Government, faction
within the Republican party struck Madison a
severe blow before he had time for defence.</p>

<p>The first sign of Republican revolt appeared in
unexpected favors lavished on the maltreated navy.
Sixteen Republican senators combined with the Federalists
to pass through the Senate a bill which ordered
every armed vessel of the government, including
gunboats, to be employed at once in active service.
Gallatin saw in this measure only an intrigue of
the Smiths and an attack upon the Treasury which
would cost six million dollars without possible advantage
to the public; but in fact the bill proved
something more than an intrigue, for it showed the
violence of New England reaction against the long
starvation of the navy. Futile as was the scheme
of manning gunboats in order to waste money which
should have been spent on construction or magazines,
New England was ready to join the Smiths or any
other faction in any vote, however unreasonable,
which promised employment for the seamen. Jefferson’s
system had shown its character most clearly
in distrust and discouragement of the navy; and no
one could wonder if the first sign of waning in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
authority appeared in that department, or if Madison’s
first difficulties occurred in the weakest part of the
old statesmanship.</p>

<p>Gallatin was taken by surprise, for the bill passed
the Senate without serious opposition; but when it
reached the House, January 10, the Treasury, through
George W. Campbell, tried to strike out the clause
which obliged the government to fit out and man
all the vessels in the service without regard to the
purpose of their employment. A number of Republican
members, largely from New England, combining
with the Federalists, defeated Campbell by a close
vote of sixty-four to fifty-nine. In alarm at a measure
which, before war was decided, threatened to
take from the Treasury and throw into the ocean
all the money reserved to support the first year of
hostilities, Gallatin exerted himself to stop it. January
11, David R. Williams and the old Republicans
came to his rescue with a motion to recommit, but
they were again beaten by fifty-nine to fifty-eight.
The next day John Montgomery of Maryland
changed sides. By a vote of sixty-nine to fifty-three
the bill was recommitted; January 13 the
House in committee struck out the mandatory clause
by fifty-three votes against forty-two; and January
16 the House accepted the amendment by sixty-eight
votes against fifty-five. These divisions showed a
considerable number of Republicans still acting with
the Federalists; and in this respect the Senate was
even less manageable than the House. Only after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
an obstinate struggle did the Senate give way so
far that at last Congress agreed upon ordering four
frigates to be fitted out, and as many gunboats as
the public service might in the President’s judgment
require.</p>

<p>The reasons given by the Senate for persisting in
its plan were proof that something remained untold;
for they showed the hand and influence of the
Smiths, rather than the interests of Madison’s coming
Administration. David R. Williams, who was a member
of the Conference Committee, reported to the
House that the managers for the Senate gave three
reasons for insisting on their bill:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first of them was that they wanted a pledge
from this House that it was willing to come forward and
defend the nation; another was that these [frigates]
were necessary to defend the gunboats in their operations;
and a third, that men could not be got to enlist
for the service of the gunboats, and that to remedy this
evil they might be enlisted to man the frigates, and afterwards
transferred.”<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>
</div>

<p>A Navy Department which used its frigates to
defend gunboats and decoy seamen was hardly fit
to be trusted with unlimited credit on the Treasury.
Gallatin lost his temper at finding his authority
threatened with overthrow by an influence which he
knew to be incompetent, and believed to be selfish
and corrupt. Irritated by the vote of January 10,
the Secretary of the Treasury studied the division-list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
to learn whence came the hostile influence which
formed what he called<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> “the navy coalition of 1809,
by whom were sacrificed forty Republican members,
nine Republican States, the Republican cause itself,
and the people of the United States, to a system
of favoritism, extravagance, parade, and folly.” He
found the central point in the “Smith faction, or
ruling party,” of which he declared Wilson Cary
Nicholas to be file-leader in the House, with six
votes. With these acted six New York followers of
Vice-President Clinton, and five “scared Yankees.”
The others were merely misled Republicans or
Federalists.</p>

<p>“The Smith faction, or ruling party,” of which
Wilson Cary Nicholas was file-leader in the House,
and which never failed to make its influence felt
in moments of trouble, had gained in the Senate an
ally whose selfishness was equal to that of General
Smith, and whose nature was far more malignant.
Of all the enemies with whom Madison had to deal,
only one in his own party was venomous. Old
George Clinton, though openly hostile, possessed strong
qualities, and in any event was too old for serious
effort. Samuel Smith played the game of politics
somewhat too much like a game of whist, in which
he allowed his trumps to fall indifferently on his
partners or on his opponents, whenever he saw the
chance to insure a trick to his own hand; but Smith
was still a man from whom in the last resort courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
and energy might be expected, and in whom, selfishness
apart, confidence could be placed. No such
redeeming quality could be truthfully attributed to
William Branch Giles, the senator from Virginia,
the third member of the senatorial cabal who was
about to place himself in the path of the Administration,
and to apply his abilities and persistence
to the deliberate task of blocking the wheels of
government.</p>

<p>Giles had served his party long and well, and
thought himself entitled to higher recognition than
he had as yet received. In later times a safe seat
in the Senate became almost the highest prize of
politics,—men sometimes preferred it to a candidacy
for the Presidential office itself; but in 1809
the Cabinet stood above the Senate, and Giles looked
upon himself as entitled to the Department of State,
and in due time to the Presidency. Madison, with
a different view of the public good and of his own
comfort, betrayed the intention of appointing Gallatin
his Secretary of State; and Gallatin’s fitness for the
post was so evident as to make his appointment the
best that could be suggested; but at the first rumor
of the intention, Giles united with Smith in threatening
to procure the rejection of Gallatin by the Senate.
To deny the President the selection of his own Secretary
of State was an act of factiousness which
remained without a parallel; but Giles and Smith
had both the will and the power to carry their point.
Even Wilson Cary Nicholas remonstrated in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the first,” was the story told by Nicholas,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
“Mr. Giles declared his determination to vote against
Gallatin. I repeatedly urged and entreated him not to
do it; for several days it was an object of discussion
between us; there was no way which our long and intimate
friendship would justify, consistent with my respect
for him, in which I did not assail him. To all
my arguments he replied that his duty to his country
was to him paramount to every other consideration, and
that he could not justify to himself permitting Gallatin
to be Secretary of State, if his vote would prevent it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus Gallatin’s foreign birth—the only objection
alleged against him—became the pretext for Giles
to declare war against the coming Administration of
President Madison. With the aid of Vice-President
Clinton, Senator Samuel Smith, and the Federalists,
Giles could control the Senate; and every factious
interest which wished to force on Madison an object
of its own was sure to ally itself with these intriguers
until its object should be conceded. The Senate was
already a hot-bed of intrigue, where William B. Giles,
Timothy Pickering, George Clinton, and Samuel
Smith held control; and unless Madison by some
great effort of force or skill could crush Giles, in
time not only the new Administration, but also the
Union itself, might find a deadly danger in the venom
of his selfishness.</p>

<p>At the close of January, affairs at Washington
were trembling on a poise. The laws required for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
Madison’s purpose were all passed save one; but the
party was rent in pieces by faction. Discipline was
at an end; the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut
were openly adopting treasonable measures; and
the great trial of strength—the decision of Congress
on immediate repeal of the embargo—had not yet
been reached.</p>

</div>


<p>Early in January the intended policy of Madison
became known. As the story has already told, Madison
and Gallatin decided to retain the embargo until
June, but to call the new Congress together May 22,
and then to declare war, unless Erskine could make
concessions. President Jefferson was chiefly interested
in maintaining the embargo until after March 4,
and the despotism he had so long maintained over
Congress seemed still to exasperate his enemies.
By common consent, attack upon the embargo was
regarded as attack upon the President: and the
Northern Democrats had so far lost respect for their
old leader as to betray almost a passion for telling
him unpleasant truths.</p>

<p>Joseph Story, who took the lead in this party rebellion,
came to Congress determined to overthrow the
embargo, and found Ezekiel Bacon—another Massachusetts
member—equally determined with himself.
In after years Justice Story told the tale as he
remembered it:<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The whole influence of the Administration was directly
brought to bear upon Mr. Ezekiel Bacon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
myself to seduce us from what we considered a great
duty to our country, and especially to New England.
We were scolded, privately consulted, and argued with
by the Administration and its friends on that occasion.
I knew at the time that Mr. Jefferson had no ulterior
measure in view, and was determined on protracting the
embargo for an indefinite period, even for years. I was
well satisfied that such a course would not and could not
be borne by New England, and would bring on a direct
rebellion. It would be ruin to the whole country. Yet
Mr. Jefferson, with his usual visionary obstinacy, was
determined to maintain it; and the New England Republicans
were to be made the instruments. Mr. Bacon and
myself resisted; and measures were concerted by us,
with the aid of Pennsylvania, to compel him to abandon
his mad scheme. For this he never forgave me.”</p>
</div>

<p>Joseph Story, with very high and amiable qualities,
was quick in temper; and in regard to Jefferson he
let his temper master his memory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One thing I did learn while I was a member of Congress,”
he continued, “and that was that New England
was expected, so far as the Republicans were concerned,
to do everything and to have nothing. They were to
obey, but not to be trusted. This, in my humble judgment,
was the steady policy of Mr. Jefferson at all times.
We were to be kept divided, and thus used to neutralize
each other.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this spirit toward his own President Story came
to Washington, and joined hands with Timothy Pickering,
John Randolph, and George Canning in the
attempt “to lower and degrade” Jefferson in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
eyes of his own people. Jefferson asked only to be
spared the indignity of signing with his own hand
the unconditional repeal of the embargo; while the
single point on which Story, Bacon, Pickering, and
Canning were agreed was that the repeal should be
the act of the man who made the law. On one side
Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, and their friends entreated
Congress to stand firm; to maintain the
ground already solemnly taken; to leave the embargo
until June, and then to declare war if they pleased.
On the other hand, Pickering, Bacon, Story, the
Clintons, and the Pennsylvanians demanded immediate
repeal,—partly to pacify New England, but
quite as much for the reason, which Pickering urged,
that immediate repeal would prevent war. That it
would in fact prevent war was obvious. Repeal was
submission.</p>

<p>Story took no part in the public struggle, for he
left Washington about January 20, and the great
debate began ten days afterward; but although he
held his peace in public, and his friends made no
open display of their anger, the temper in which
they acted was notorious, and the breach between
them and Jefferson was never healed. They could
not forgive him: that Jefferson should ever forget
the wound they inflicted, required magnanimity beyond
that of any philosopher known in politics.</p>

<p>As soon as the naval and military bills and the
extra session for May 22 were at last fairly determined
and every detail decided, Wilson Cary Nicholas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
took the lead of the House, and January 30 called
up a Resolution intended to settle the policy of embargo
and war. The words of this Resolve were too
serious not to have received very careful attention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, As the opinion of this House, that the
United States ought not to delay beyond the —— day
of —— to resume, maintain, and defend the navigation
of the high seas; and that provision ought to be made
by law for repealing on the —— day of —— the several
embargo laws, and for authorizing at the same time
letters of marque and reprisal against Great Britain and
France, provided on that day their Orders or Edicts violating
the lawful commerce and neutral rights of the
United States shall be in force; or against either of those
nations having in force such Orders or Edicts.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nicholas agreed to divide the Resolution so that a
test vote might first be taken on the repeal of the
embargo; and he then moved to fill the blank with
the words, “the first day of June.” The House
was thus asked to pledge itself that on June 1 the
embargo should cease. On this question the debate
began.</p>

<p>David R. Williams was a typical Carolinian. With
something of the overbearing temper which marked
his class, he had also the independence and the honesty
which went far to redeem their failings. He
had stood for years, with his friend Macon, proof
against the influence of patronage and power; he
supported the embargo, and was not ashamed to
avow his dread of war; but since his favorite measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
was to be thrown aside, he stood by his character,
and made an appeal to the House, giving at
once to the debate an air of dignity which it never
wholly lost:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Will you drive us to a repeal of the embargo, and
make no resistance? Are you ready to lie down quietly
under the impositions laid upon you? You have driven
us from the embargo. The excitements in the East render
it necessary that we should enforce the embargo with
the bayonet or repeal it. I will repeal it,—and I could
weep over it more than over a lost child. If you do
not resist, you are no longer a nation; you dare not
call yourself so; you are the merest vassals conceivable....
I appeal to the minority, who hold the destinies
of the nation in their grasp,—for they can enforce
embargo without the bayonet,—I beg them, if they will
not declare war, that they will do the best they can for
their country.”</p>
</div>

<p>No one then wondered to see South Carolina almost
on her knees before Massachusetts, beseeching her,
on her own terms, for her own honor, to do the best
she could for the common country; but Massachusetts
had no voice to respond. Dryly, in the caustic
tone of Connecticut austerity, Samuel Dana replied
that the days of ancient chivalry had not yet returned.
When Massachusetts at last found a spokesman,
she gave her answer through the mouth of
Ezekiel Bacon,—a man second to none in respectability,
but not one whom, in a moment of supreme
crisis, the State would naturally have chosen among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
all her citizens to pronounce her will. Bacon had
carefully collected advice from the men in his State
who were most competent to give counsel;<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> but in
Massachusetts affairs at Washington were little understood.
Bent only on saving the Union by forcing
a repeal of the embargo, and hampered by alliance
with Federalists and Pennsylvanians, Bacon could not
afford to show a sense of national self-respect.</p>

<p>He began by admitting that the discontents in New
England made immediate repeal necessary:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It surely could not be sound policy, by adhering to
this system beyond the measure of absolute necessity,
to risk in the hands of any faction which might be disposed
to wield it an instrument by which they may endanger
the union of our country, and raise themselves to
power on the ruins of liberty and the Constitution.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such a beginning, offering a reward for threats of
disunion, and conceding to traitors what would have
been refused to good citizens, was an evil augury;
and the rest of Bacon’s speech carried out the promise.
As he refused to prolong the embargo, so he
refused to vote for war. “In every point of view, the
policy of declaring offensive war against any nation
four months in advance is to me wholly objectionable.”
The conclusion was as feeble as was required
by the premises; but only some demon of bad taste
could have inspired an orator at such a moment to
use the language of Falstaff;—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We choose not to take measures any more than to
give reasons ‘upon compulsion,’ and we will not so take
them. We will, however, I trust, defend ourselves
against the depredations of both [belligerents]; and if
they both or either choose to persevere in the execution
of their lawless aggressions, we shall, it is hoped, become
more united in our determination and our efforts to
vindicate our rights, if they shall continue to be assailed.
At any rate, I am for leaving it to the wisdom of the ensuing
Congress, which is to meet at an early day, to
determine upon that position which the nation shall take
in relation to such a state of things as may grow out of
the course which I propose.”</p>
</div>

<p>Between the Federalists and the Republicans of
Massachusetts Congress was left under no illusions.
Bacon expressed in these vacillating phrases the true
sense of the country. On the evening of February 2,
after four days of debate, the committee, by seventy-three
votes against forty, rejected Wilson Cary Nicholas’s
motion to fix June 1 as the date for removing
the embargo; and the next day, by an affirmative
vote of seventy, with no negatives, March 4 was fixed
as the term.</p>

<p>Immediately after this decisive division John
Randolph took the floor. Discord had become his
single object in public life. The Federalists at least
had a purpose in their seditiousness, and were honest
in preferring the British government to their
own; the Republicans of all shades, however weak in
will or poor in motive, were earnest in their love
of country; but Randolph was neither honest nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
earnest, neither American nor English nor truly
Virginian. Disappointed ambition had turned him
into a mere egoist; his habits had already become
intemperate, and his health was broken; but he could
still charge upon Jefferson all the disasters of the
country, and could delight in the overwhelming ruin
which had fallen upon his former chief. Randolph’s
speech of February 3 was stale and tedious. Except
on the single point of raising the embargo he was
spiritless; and his only positive idea, borrowed from
the Federalists, consisted in a motion that, instead
of issuing letters of marque, Government should authorize
merchant-vessels to arm and defend themselves
from seizure. If the scheme had a meaning,
it meant submission to the British Orders, and was
suggested by the Federalists for no other object; but
in Randolph’s mind such a plan carried no definite
consequence.</p>

<p>On Randolph’s motion the debate continued until
February 7. The Republicans, disconcerted and disheartened
by the conduct of their friends from New
England and New York, made little show of energy,
and left to David R. Williams the task of expressing
the whole ignominy of their defeat. Williams struggled
manfully. Randolph’s fears for the Constitution
were answered by the South Carolinian in a few
words, which condensed into a single paragraph the
results of his party theories:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the Constitution is made of such brittle stuff as
not to stand a single war; if it is only to be preserved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
submission to foreign taxation,—I shall very soon lose
all solicitude for its preservation.”</p>
</div>

<p>With more than Federalist bitterness he taunted
the hesitation of the Democrats,—“contemptible
cowardice,” he called it. “It is time we should <i>assume</i>,
if it is not in our natures, nerve enough to
decide whether we will go to war or submit.” The
House replied by striking out the recommendation of
reprisals, by a vote of fifty-seven to thirty-nine.</p>

<p>These two votes rendered the Administration for
the moment powerless to make head against the
sweeping Federalist victory. Josiah Quincy, who
watched every symptom of democratic disaster, wrote
as early as February 2, before the first defeat of the
Administration:<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> “There is dreadful distraction in
the enemy’s camp on the subject of removing the
embargo. Jefferson and his friends are obstinate.
Bacon and the Northern Democrats are equally determined
that it shall be raised in March.” The
next day Quincy added: “Jefferson is a host; and if
the wand of that magician is not broken, he will yet
defeat the attempt.”</p>

<p>The contest had become personal; to break the
“wand of the magician” was as much the object of
Democrats as of Federalists, and neither Madison
nor Gallatin could restore discipline. February 4
the Secretary of the Treasury wrote:<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> “As far as
my information goes, everything grows more quiet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
Massachusetts and Maine. All would be well if our
friends remained firm here.”</p>

<p>The attempt to hold the friends of the Administration
firm brought only greater disaster. The vote in
committee refusing to recommend reprisals took place
February 7; and the next day Quincy wrote again:
“Great caucusing is the order of the day and the
night here. The Administration is determined to
rally its friends, and postpone the removal of the
embargo till May. But I think they cannot succeed.
Bacon, I am told, stands firm and obstinate against
all their solicitations and even almost denunciations.
However, they had another caucus last night. The
event is unknown. Jefferson has prevailed.”</p>

<p>February 9 the result of the caucus was shown by
a vote of the House discharging the Committee of the
Whole, and referring the subject to the Committee of
Foreign Relations, whose chairman was G. W. Campbell,—which
amounted to a public admission that
Madison’s plan had failed, and that some new expedient
for uniting the party must be invented. Ezekiel
Bacon refused to obey the caucus, and voted with the
Federalists against the reference.</p>

<p>President Jefferson, though his name was still a
terror to his enemies, accepted whatever decision his
Cabinet advised. Till the day of his death he never
forgot the violence of these last weeks of his administration,
or the outcry of the New England towns.
“How powerfully did we feel the energy of this organization
in the case of the embargo,” he wrote long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
afterward.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> “I felt the foundations of the government
shaken under my feet by the New England
townships.” He showed the same lack of interest
in February which had marked his conduct in November;
not even the certainty of his own overthrow
called out the familiar phrases of vexation.
February 7 he wrote to his son-in-law, Thomas Mann
Randolph,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I thought Congress had taken their ground firmly for
continuing their embargo till June, and then war. But
a sudden and unaccountable revolution of opinion took
place the last week, chiefly among the New England and
New York members, and in a kind of panic they voted
the 4th of March for removing the embargo, and by
such a majority as gave all reason to believe they would
not agree either to war or non-intercourse. This, too,
was after we had become satisfied that the Essex Junto
had found their expectation desperate, of inducing the
people there either to separation or forcible opposition.
The majority of Congress, however, has now rallied to
the removing the embargo on the 4th March, non-intercourse
with France and Great Britain, trade everywhere
else, and continuing war preparations. The
further details are not yet settled, but I believe it is
perfectly certain that the embargo will be taken off the
4th of March.”</p>
</div>

<p>As the President became more subdued, Senator
Pickering became more vehement; his hatred for
Jefferson resembled the hatred of Cotton Mather for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
a witch. February 4 he wrote to his nephew in
Boston:<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I entertain no doubt that Jefferson stands pledged
to Bonaparte to maintain the embargo until a non-intercourse
or war shall succeed; and he dreads the
explosion justly to be apprehended by him from the
disappointment and passion of Bonaparte, should the
embargo be removed without a substitute as well or
better comporting with his views. Upon this aspect
of things it behooves our State legislature to advance
with a firm step in defence of the rights of our citizens
and of the Constitution. The palatines tremble at their
posts. The least relaxation or wavering in the councils
of New England would give them fresh courage, and
hazard the most disastrous consequences.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another observer wrote comments, serious in a
different sense. Erskine watched with extreme interest
every detail of this complicated struggle, and
reported to Canning both facts and speculations
which could not fail to affect the British government.
Aware that Canning had won a brilliant success,
Erskine labored to profit by his triumph, and to turn
it in the interests of peace. A vast majority of
Americans, he said,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> wanted only some plausible excuse
to justify them in resenting Napoleon’s conduct;
but “they naturally wish to be saved the complete
humiliation of being obliged avowedly to recant all
their violent declarations of their determination never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
to submit to the Orders in Council of Great Britain.”
He speculated “how far it might be possible still
further to bend the spirit of that part of the people
of the United States until they should be forced to
single out France to be resisted as the original
aggressors while his Majesty’s Orders in Council
continued to be enforced.” After the repeal of the
embargo and the refusal to make war, but one remnant
of American protest against British aggressions
remained. The Republican caucus, February 7, decided
in favor of returning to Jefferson’s pacific
non-intercourse,—the system which had been, by
common consent, thrown aside as insufficient even
before the embargo. February 10 Erskine gave an
account of the new measure, and of its probable
effect on American politics:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is true that a non-intercourse law may be considered
by the Eastern States very objectionable; but as it
would be rather a nominal prohibition than a rigorous
enforcement, a resistance to it would be less likely to be
made, and of less importance if it should take place.
The ultimate consequences of such differences and jealousies
arising between the Southern and Eastern States
would inevitably tend to a dissolution of the Union,
which has been for some time talked of, and has of late,
as I have heard, been seriously contemplated by many of
the leading people in the Eastern division.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Non-intercourse Bill, which Erskine described
February 10 as likely to be no more than a nominal
prohibition of commerce, was reported February 11 to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
the House from the Committee of Foreign Relations
The bill excluded all public and private vessels of
France and England from American waters; forbade
under severe penalties the importation of British or
French goods; repealed the embargo laws, “except
so far as they relate to Great Britain or France
or their colonies or dependencies, or places in the
actual possession of either;” and gave the President
authority to reopen by proclamation the trade with
France or England in case either of these countries
should cease to violate neutral rights. That the proposed
non-intercourse was in truth submission to the
Orders in Council, no one denied.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I conceive that great advantages may be reaped
from it by England,” wrote Erskine,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> “as she has the
command of the seas, and can procure through neutrals
any of the produce of this country, besides the
immense quantity which will be brought direct to Great
Britain under various pretences; whereas France will
obtain but little, at a great expense and risk.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such a non-intercourse merely sanctioned smuggling,
and was intended for no other purpose. Gallatin
in his disgust flung open the doors to illicit
commerce. When Erskine went to him to ask what
was meant by “France, England, and their dependencies,”
Gallatin replied that only places in actual
possession of England and France were intended;
that it was impossible to say what nations had decrees
in force infringing neutral rights, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
even Holland would be considered an independent
country.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The intention of this indefinite description,” continued
Erskine, “is undoubtedly to leave open as many
places for their commerce as they can, consistently with
keeping up an appearance of resistance to the belligerent
restrictions; but it is thoroughly understood that the
whole measure is a mere subterfuge to extricate themselves
from the embarrassments of the embargo system,
and is never intended to be enforced.”</p>
</div>

<p>When this bill came before the House, another
long debate arose. Hardly a trace of national pride
remained. No one approved the bill, but no one
struggled longer against submission. Josiah Quincy
and many of the Federalists held that the surrender
was not yet complete enough, and that total submission
to Great Britain must precede the return of Massachusetts
to harmony with the Union, or to a share
in measures of government. His words were worth
noting:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He wished peace if possible; if war, union in that
war. For this reason he wished a negotiation to be
opened, unshackled with those impediments to it which
now existed. As long as they remained, the people in
the portion of country whence he came would not deem
an unsuccessful attempt at negotiation to be cause for
war. If they were removed, and an earnest attempt at
negotiation was made, unimpeded with these restrictions,
and should not meet with success, they would join heartily
in a war.”</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span></p>
<p>Doubtless Quincy believed the truth of what he
said; but as though to prove him mistaken in claiming
even the modest amount of patriotism which he
asserted for his party, Barent Gardenier immediately
followed with a declaration that Great Britain was
wholly in the right, and that America should not only
submit to the Orders in Council, but should take
pride in submission:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I do not say that the orders were lawful, or that
they were not infringements of our rights as a neutral
nation,—as it might offend the prejudices of the House.
But I may be permitted to say that if they were unlawful,
I have proved that they are not hurtful; that the British
Orders in Council only supplied to that which our sense
of honor would lead us to do, their sanction.”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Gardenier’s views roused no longer much outward
irritation. The war Republicans liked honest avowals
better than sham patriotism; but John Randolph, unwilling
to be embarrassed with allies so candid, rated
Gardenier sharply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I looked at the gentleman from New York at that
moment with the sort of sensation which we feel in beholding
a sprightly child meddling with edged tools,—every
moment expecting, what actually happened, that
he will cut his fingers.... The gentleman’s friends, if
any he have,—and I have no right to presume that he
has none, but the contrary,—will do well to keep such
dangerous implements out of his way for the future.”</p>
</div>

<p>Randolph himself persisted in the scheme of withdrawing
all restrictions on commerce, and allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
merchant-vessels to arm,—a measure which had the
advantage of being warlike or pacific, according as he
should prefer in the future to represent it. David R.
Williams hit upon an idea more sensible, and likely
to prove more effective. “If the embargo is to be
taken off, and war not to be substituted,—if the
nation is to submit,—I wish to do it profitably.” He
proposed to shut out the shipping of England and
France, but to admit their manufactures, under a
duty of fifty per cent when imported in American
vessels. A number of Southern Republicans approved
this plan.</p>

<p>Much the strongest speech against the bill was
that of George W. Campbell, who made no attempt
to hide his mortification at seeing the House desert
him, its leader, and turn its back upon the pledge it
had solemnly given in accepting his Report only two
months before:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At the very time when your own people are rallying
round the standard of their government; when they are
about to shake off that timidity, that alarm, that restless
disposition, which the first pressure occasioned by the
suspension of commerce naturally produced; when they
are, in almost every quarter of the Union, declaring their
determination and solemnly pledging themselves to support
your measures, to maintain the embargo, or go to
war if necessary,—to do anything but submit: at that
very moment, instead of being invited by a similar patriotic
enthusiasm to throw yourselves in front, and to
lead them on to the honorable contest, you abandon the
ground you have already occupied, you check their generous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
enthusiasm, and leave them the mortification of
seeing their country disgraced by a timid, temporizing
policy that must, if persevered in, ruin the nation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although events had already proved that no appeal
to self-respect called out a response from this
Congress, Campbell might reasonably suppose that
arguments of self-interest would be heard; and he
pressed one objection to the bill which, in theory,
should have been decisive:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The non-intercourse would press most severely on
the Southern and Western States, who depend chiefly on
the immediate exchange of their productions for foreign
goods, and would throw almost the whole commerce of
the nation into the hands of the Eastern States, without
competition, and also add a premium on their manufactures
at the expense of the agricultural interest to the
South and West. Foreign goods being excluded, the
manufacturing States would furnish the rest of the Union
with their manufactured goods at their own prices.”</p>
</div>

<p>A moment’s reflection must have satisfied the
Republicans that this argument against the bill was
fatal. Non-intercourse must ruin the South, in order
to offer an immense bribe to the shipping and manufactures
of New England as an inducement for New
England to remain in the Union. The manufacturing
interests never ventured to ask such extravagant
protection as was thrust upon them in 1809 by the
fears of the agricultural States; the greed of corporate
capital never suggested the monopoly created
for Eastern ships and factories by a measure which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
shut from America all ships and manufactures but
theirs. Even if but partially enforced, such legislation
was ruinous to agriculture.</p>

<p>Entreaty and argument were thrown away. The
House lost discipline, self-respect, and party character.
No one felt responsible for any result, no
majority approved any suggestion. As the last days
of the session drew near, the machinery of legislation
broke down, and Congress became helpless. So
strange and humiliating a spectacle had not before
been seen. The nation seemed sinking into the
weakness of dissolution.</p>

<p>The paralysis came in a form that could not be
disguised. While the House disputed over one Non-intercourse
Bill, the Senate passed another; and February
22 the House laid aside its own measure in
order to take up that of the Senate, which contained
the disputed clause authorizing letters of marque and
reprisal against nations that should continue their
unlawful edicts after repeal of the embargo. In pursuance
of its vote of February 7, the House in committee
promptly struck out the reprisal clause. Next
it rejected David R. Williams’s motion for discriminating
duties. Ezekiel Bacon, perhaps somewhat
scandalized at the legislation he had chiefly caused,
suggested the Federalist plan of authorizing merchant-vessels
to resist seizure; and February 25 a struggle
occurred on the question of permitting forcible resistance
by merchant-vessels. The minority was
deeply agitated as the act of complete submission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
became imminent. David R. Williams cried that
if the House could so abandon national rights, they
deserved to be scoffed by all the world; John W.
Eppes declared himself compelled to believe Josiah
Quincy’s assertion that the majority could not be
kicked into a war; even the peaceable Macon moved
a warlike amendment. Vote after vote was taken;
again and again the ayes and noes were called on
dilatory motions of adjournment; but every motion
looking toward war was steadily voted down, and
in the end, February 27, the Non-intercourse Bill in
its most unresisting shape received the approval of
the House. Not a speaker defended it; at the last
moment the charge was freely made that the bill had
not a single friend. The members who voted for it
declared in doing so that the measure was a weak
and wretched expedient, that they detested it, and
took it merely as a choice of evils; but eighty-one
members voted in its favor, and only forty in the
negative. More extraordinary still, this non-intercourse,
which bound the South to the feet of New
England, was supported by forty-one Southern members,
while but twelve New England representatives
recorded their names in its favor.</p>

<p>Three months afterward, at a moment when the
danger of war seemed to have vanished, John Randolph
recalled the memory of this confused struggle,
and claimed for President Jefferson and himself the
credit for having prevented a declaration of war. He
had voted against the non-intercourse, he said, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
he had believed that he could get rid of the embargo
on still better terms; others had voted against
it because they thought it absolute disgrace:<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact is that nobody would advocate it; that
though it was carried by a majority of two to one, those
who finally voted for it condemned it, and all parties
seemed ashamed of it; and that ... all the high-toned
men and high-toned presses in this country denounced
the majority of this House for passing that law, as
having utterly disgraced themselves.... If the great
leaders could have been gratified, according to their own
showing they would have dragged this country into a
war with Great Britain.... Now to be sure, sir, those
persons who undertook to stop their wild career were
composed of heterogeneous materials; ... there were
minority men, caucus men, protesters,—in fact, sir, all
parties, Catholics, Protestants, Seceders,—and all were
united in the effort to prevent the leaders of both Houses
from plunging the nation into a war with one Power and
knuckling to the other; from riveting the chains of
French influence, perhaps of French alliance upon us.
Thank God that their designs were proclaimed to the
nation, that the President did not give his consent, which
would have made us kick the beam. Yes, sir! Federalists,
minority men, protesters, and all would have
kicked the beam if it had ever emanated from the Cabinet
that the President was for war.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Randolph was right, the “wand of the magician”
had not been broken; and other observers besides
Randolph held the same opinion. “Jefferson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
has triumphed,” wrote Josiah Quincy, February 27,
immediately after the repeal; “his intrigues have
prevailed.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>In a spirit widely different from that of Randolph
and Quincy, Nathaniel Macon, February 28, wrote
to his friend Nicholson,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Otis, the Secretary of the Senate, has this moment
informed the House of Representatives that the Senate
have agreed to the amendments made by the House to
the Bill to repeal the embargo.</p>

<p>“The Lord, the mighty Lord, must come to our assistance,
or I fear we are undone as a nation!”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

</div>


<p>The repeal of the embargo, which received the
President’s signature March 1, closed the long reign
of President Jefferson; and with but one exception
the remark of John Randolph was destined to remain
true, that “never has there been any Administration
which went out of office and left the nation in a state
so deplorable and calamitous.” That the blame for
this failure rested wholly upon Jefferson might be
doubted; but no one felt more keenly than he the
disappointment under which his old hopes and ambitions
were crushed.</p>

<p>Loss of popularity was his bitterest trial. He who
longed like a sensitive child for sympathy and love
left office as strongly and almost as generally disliked
as the least popular President who preceded
or followed him. He had undertaken to create a
government which should interfere in no way with
private action, and he had created one which interfered
directly in the concerns of every private citizen
in the land. He had come into power as the champion
of State-rights, and had driven States to the
verge of armed resistance. He had begun by claiming
credit for stern economy, and ended by exceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
the expenditure of his predecessors. He had invented
a policy of peace, and his invention resulted in the
necessity of fighting at once the two greatest Powers
in the world.</p>

<p>The feelings of the New England Democrats have
been described in their own words. Angry as Ezekiel
Bacon and Joseph Story were, their bitterness against
Jefferson was hardly so great as that of the Clintonians
in New York; but the same irritation extended
even into the compact democracy of Pennsylvania.
In the preceding summer, before the Presidential
election, A. J. Dallas said to Gallatin:<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> “I verily believe
one year more of writing, speaking, and appointing
would render Mr. Jefferson a more odious President,
even to the Democrats, than John Adams.” So
far as could be judged from the conduct of the party,
the prophecy became truth. The Southern Republicans,
always loyal to a Southern President, would not
openly turn against their old leader, but the Northern
Democrats made no disguise of their aversion.</p>

<p>Not even in 1798 had factiousness been so violent as
in the last month of President Jefferson’s power; in
1800 the country in comparison had been contented.
Feb. 23, 1809, nearly three weeks after the disastrous
overthrow of the embargo in Congress, the Connecticut
legislature met in special session to “interpose”
between the people and the national government. In
a Report echoing the words of Governor Trumbull’s
speech, the House instantly approved his refusal to aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
in carrying out the “unconstitutional and despotic”
Enforcement Act, and pledged itself to join the legislature
of Massachusetts in the measures proposed “to
give to the commercial States their fair and just
consideration in the Union.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The spirit in which
Massachusetts meant to act was shown in a formal
Address to the People issued by her Legislature
March 1, bearing the official signatures of Harrison
Gray Otis, President of the Senate, and Timothy
Bigelow, Speaker of the House.</p>

<p>“Protesting in the sight of God the sincerity of
their attachment to the Union of the States, and their
determination to cherish and preserve it at every
hazard until it shall fail to secure to them those
blessings which alone give value to any form of government,”
the Massachusetts legislature laid before
the people of the State certain Reports and measures
adopted for the purpose of impeding the embargo
laws, and apologized for having done no more, on
the ground that more could not have been done
“without authorizing a forcible resistance to Acts of
Congress,—an ultimate resource so deeply to be deprecated
that the cases which might justify it should
not be trusted even to the imagination until they
actually happen.” Less than forty years before, Massachusetts
had used much the same language in regard
to Acts of Parliament, and the world knew what
then followed; but even in the bitterest controversies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
over Stamp Act or Port Bill, the General Court of
Massachusetts had never insulted King George as
they insulted President Jefferson. The Address at
great length asserted that his Government was laboring
under “an habitual and impolitic predilection for
France;” and even in making this assertion it apologized
for England in terms which echoed the words
of Canning and Castlereagh:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Without pretending to compare and adjust the respective
injuries sustained from the two nations, it cannot
be disguised that in some instances our nation has
received from Great Britain compensation; in others
offers of atonement, and in all the language of conciliation
and respect.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, war with England must lead
to alliance with France; and that a connection with
France “must be forever fatal to the liberty and independence
of the nation is obvious to all who are not
blinded by partiality and passion.”</p>

<p>Such reasoning had the merits of its emphasis.
The case of forcible resistance which could not be
trusted to the imagination until it happened pointed
designedly to a war with England, which, being equivalent
to a connection with France, must be forever
fatal to the liberty and independence of the United
States. The dogma that a British war must dissolve
the Union had become more than ever an article of
Federalist faith. Even Rufus King, writing to Pickering,
January 31, said:<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> “The embargo, as we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
now told, is to give way to war. If the project be to
unite with France against England, the Union cannot
be preserved.” To prevent war with England was to
prevent a dissolution of the Union; and the legislature
of Massachusetts, acting on that idea, closed what
it called its “Patriotick Proceedings,” by declaring
to the people of the Commonwealth the measures by
which alone the Union could be saved:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As the malady is deep, you will still be deceived by
trusting to any temporary relief. You must realize and
comprehend the nature of your peculiar interests, and by
steady, persevering, and well-concerted efforts rise into
an attitude to promote and preserve them. The farmer
must remember that his prosperity is inseparable from
that of the merchant; and that there is little affinity
between his condition and habits and those of a Southern
planter. The interests of New England must be
defined, understood, and firmly represented. A perfect
intelligence must be cultivated among those States, and
a united effort must be made and continued to acquire
their just influence in the national government. For this
purpose the Constitution should be amended, and the provision
which gives to holders of slaves a representation
equal to that of six hundred thousand free citizens should
be abolished. Experience proves the injustice, and time
will increase the inequality, of this principle, the original
reason for which has entirely failed. Other amendments
to secure commerce and navigation from a repetition of
destructive and insidious theories are indispensable.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such were the conditions on which Massachusetts
must insist:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Legislature are aware that their measures and
sentiments will encourage their opponents in propagating
the foul imputation of a design to dismember the Union.
But when did party malice want a theme to excite popular
prejudice? When did it have recourse to one more
absurd and unfounded?”</p>
</div>

<p>The object of the Federalist majority was to
strengthen the Union,—so they protested and so they
doubtless believed; but in truth they insisted upon
creating a new Union as a condition of their remaining
in the old. The fatal word “must” ran through
all their demands:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the Southern States are disposed to avail themselves
of the advantages resulting from our strength and
resources for common defence, they must be willing to
patronize the interests of navigation and commerce without
which our strength will be weakness. If they wish
to appropriate a portion of the public revenue toward
roads, canals, or for the purchase of arms and the improvement
of their militia, they must consent that you
who purchase your own arms, and have already roads,
canals, and militia in most excellent order, shall have
another portion of it devoted to naval protection. If
they in the spirit of chivalry are ready to rush into an
unnecessary and ruinous war with one nation, they must
suffer you to pause before you bid an eternal adieu to
your independence by an alliance with another.”</p>
</div>

<p>Union of New England against the national Union—an
idea hitherto confined to the brain of Timothy
Pickering—had become the avowed object of the
Massachusetts and Connecticut legislatures. “Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
less than a perfect union and intelligence among
the Eastern States” could answer the objects of
Pickering; but side by side with the perfect union
of the Eastern States went a perfect intelligence between
those States and the British government. On
one side, Pickering maintained relations with Rose;
on the other, Sir James Craig kept a secret agent at
Boston. January 26, at the moment when the crisis
of war or peace was about to be decided at Washington,
Mr. Ryland at Quebec, on behalf of the Governor-General
of Canada, sent for John Henry to undertake
another winter journey through New England.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> His
instructions, dated February 6 and signed by Sir
James, Craig himself, enjoined the utmost secrecy, and
restricted Henry to the task of ascertaining how far,
in case of war, the Federalists of the Eastern States
would look to England for assistance, or be disposed
to enter into a connection with the British government.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
Only in case the Federalist leaders should
express a wish to that effect was Henry cautiously to
avow his official character, and to receive any communication
for transmittal. February 10 Henry started
on this errand, but before he reached Boston the
news that Congress had decided to repeal the embargo
without declaring war left him little to do.
He remained quietly in Boston, in familiar relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
with the Federalist leaders,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> without betraying his
errand; and the substance of his reports to the
governor-general amounted only to a decided opinion
that the Federalists were not yet ready to act: “I
can assure you that at this moment they do not
freely entertain the project of withdrawing the Eastern
States from the Union, finding it a very unpopular
topic.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Until midsummer, when the last fear of
war vanished, this accredited agent of the governor-general
waited at Boston for events. “His manners
being gentlemanly and his letters of introduction
good,” said Josiah Quincy, “he was admitted freely
into society and heard the conversation at private
tables.”</p>

<p>Had Jefferson known that a British emissary was
secretly waiting at Boston to profit by the result of
eight years’ Republican policy, he could not but have
felt deep personal mortification mingled with his
sense of wrong. Of all Jefferson’s hopes, perhaps the
warmest had been that of overthrowing the power
of his New England enemies,—those whom he had
once called the monarchical Federalists,—the clergy
and the Essex Junto. Instead of overthrowing them
he had given them, for the first time in their lives,
unlimited power for mischief; he had overthrown
only the moderate Federalists, who when forced to
choose between treason and embargo submitted to
the embargo and hated its author. The Essex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
Junto became supreme in New England; and behind
it stood the power of Great Britain, ready to
interpose, if necessary, for its defence.</p>

<p>Jefferson submitted in silence, and even with an
air of approval, to the abrupt abandonment of his
favorite measure. He admitted that the embargo
had failed; he even exaggerated its evils, and described
it as more costly than war. His language
implied that the failure of peaceable coercion was no
longer a matter of doubt in his mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The belligerent edicts,” he wrote to Armstrong,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
“rendered our embargo necessary to call home our ships,
our seamen, and property. We expected some effect,
too, from the coercion of interest. Some it has had, but
much less on account of evasions and domestic opposition
to it. After fifteen months’ continuance, it is now discontinued
because, losing fifty million dollars of exports
annually by it, it costs more than war, which might be
carried on for a third of that, besides what might be got
by reprisal.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Dupont de Nemours Jefferson wrote in the same
strain.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> He signed without the betrayal of a protest
the bill repealing the embargo, and talked of war as
a necessary evil. Not until more than a year afterward
did he admit the bitterness of his disappointment
and mortification; but July 16, 1810, he wrote
to his old Secretary of War a letter which expressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
in his familiar note of irritability, the feelings he
had pent up:<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Federalists during their short-lived ascendency
have nevertheless, by forcing us from the embargo, inflicted
a wound on our interests which can never be
cured, and on our affections which will require time to
cicatrize. I ascribe all this to one pseudo-Republican,—Story.
He came on in place of Crowninshield, I believe,
and stayed only a few days,—long enough, however, to
get complete hold of Bacon, who, giving in to his representations,
became panic-struck, and communicated the
panic to his colleagues, and they to a majority of the
sound members of Congress. They believed in the alternative
of repeal or civil war, and produced the fatal
measure of repeal.... I have ever been anxious to
avoid a war with England unless forced by a situation
more losing than war itself; but I did believe we could
coerce her to justice by peaceable means; and the embargo,
evaded as it was, proved it would have coerced
her had it been honestly executed. The proof she exhibited
on that occasion that she can exercise such an
influence in this country as to control the will of its government
and three fourths of its people is to me the
most mortifying circumstance which has occurred since
the establishment of our government.”</p>
</div>

<p>In truth, the disaster was appalling; and Jefferson
described it in moderate terms by admitting that the
policy of peaceable coercion brought upon him mortification
such as no other President ever suffered. So
complete was his overthrow that his popular influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
declined even in the South. Twenty years elapsed
before his political authority recovered power over
the Northern people; for not until the embargo and
its memories faded from men’s minds did the mighty
shadow of Jefferson’s Revolutionary name efface the
ruin of his Presidency. Yet he clung with more and
more tenacity to the faith that his theory of peaceable
coercion was sound; and when within a few
months of his death he alluded for the last time to
the embargo, he spoke of it as “a measure which,
persevered in a little longer, we had subsequent and
satisfactory assurance would have effected its object
completely.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>A discomfiture so conspicuous could not fail to
bring in its train a swarm of petty humiliations which
for the moment were more painful than the great
misfortune. Jefferson had hoped to make his country
forever pure and free; to abolish war, with its train
of debt, extravagance, corruption, and tyranny; to
build up a government devoted only to useful and
moral objects; to bring upon earth a new era of peace
and good-will among men. Throughout the twistings
and windings of his course as President he clung to
this main idea; or if he seemed for a moment to
forget it, he never failed to return and to persist with
almost heroic obstinacy in enforcing its lessons. By
repealing the embargo, Congress avowedly and even
maliciously rejected and trampled upon the only part
of Jefferson’s statesmanship which claimed originality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
or which in his own opinion entitled him to rank as a
philosophic legislator. The mortification he felt was
natural and extreme, but such as every great statesman
might expect, and such as most of them experienced.
The supreme bitterness of the moment lay
rather in the sudden loss of respect and consideration
which at all times marked the decline of power, but
became most painful when the surrender of office
followed a political defeat at the hands of supposed
friends.</p>

<p>The last days of his authority were embittered by
a personal slight which wounded him deeply. After
the peace of Tilsit the Emperor Alexander of Russia
expressed a wish to exchange ministers with the
United States government. In every point of view
America must gain by winning the friendship of
Russia; and much as Jefferson disliked multiplying
diplomatic offices, he could not but feel that at a
time when his ministers were likely at any moment
to be driven from France and England, nothing could
be more useful than to secure a foothold at St. Petersburg.
Without loss of time he created the mission,
and appointed his old personal friend William Short
to the new post. In August, 1808, during the recess
of Congress, he sent Short to Europe, with orders to
stop at Paris until the Senate should confirm his
appointment. For political reasons Jefferson waited
till the close of the session, and then, February 24,
made this appointment the subject of his last Message
to the Senate, explaining the motives which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
induced him to create a diplomatic agency at St.
Petersburg, and announcing that Short had received
his commission and had gone to Europe six months
before on this errand.</p>

<p>No sooner had the Senate, on receiving this Message,
gone into executive session than Senator Bradley
of Vermont offered a Resolution that any intercourse
with Russia, such as the President suggested, might
“be carried on with equal facility and effect by other
public agents of the United States without the expense
of a permanent minister plenipotentiary;” or
in case of sudden negotiations for peace in Europe,
“the permanent minister at any of the Courts thereof
may be instructed to attend on the same;” and that
for these reasons the proposed appointment was at
present inexpedient and unnecessary. After much
secret debate, Senator Bradley, February 27, withdrew
his motion, and the Senate then abruptly and
unanimously rejected Short’s nomination.</p>

<p>The discourtesy was flagrant. As a matter of
policy the new mission might fairly be subject for
argument; and the Senate had a right, if it chose,
to follow its own opinions on such a subject. Unreasonable
as was the idea of sending hither and
thither the American ministers “at any of the Courts
of Europe,” when every senator knew that on the
continent of Europe America had but one minister,
and even he was on the verge of dismissal or recall;
ill-judged as was the assertion that a consular agent
could carry on “with equal facility and effect” at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
Court like that of St. Petersburg a diplomatic intercourse
which would need every resource of public and
private influence; narrow as was the policy of refusing
“the expense of a permanent minister plenipotentiary”
to the only nation in the world which offered
her friendship at a moment when England and France
were doing their utmost to spare America the expense
of legations at London and Paris,—yet these
objections to Jefferson’s wish were such as the Senate
might naturally make, for they were the established
creed of the Republican party, and no one had done
more than Jefferson himself to erect them into a
party dogma. Dislike of diplomacy was a relic of
the old colonial status when America had been dependent
on Europe,—a prejudice rising chiefly from
an uneasy sense of social disadvantage. Whenever
America should become strong and self-confident,
these petty jealousies were sure to disappear, and
her relations with other Powers would be controlled
solely by her wants; but meanwhile the Senate in
every emergency might be expected to embarrass the
relations of the Executive with foreign governments,
and to give untenable reasons for its conduct. That
the Senate should object, could have been no surprise
to Jefferson; but that it should without even a private
explanation reject abruptly and unanimously the
last personal favor asked by a President for whom
every Republican senator professed friendship, and
from whom most had received innumerable favors,
seemed an unpardonable insult. So Jefferson felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
it. He wrote to Short in accents of undisguised
mortification:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is with much concern I inform you that the Senate
has negatived your appointment. We thought it best to
keep back the nomination to the close of the session,
that the mission might remain secret as long as possible,
which you know was our purpose from the beginning.
It was then sent in with an explanation of its object
and motives. We took for granted, if any hesitation
should arise, that the Senate would take time, and that
our friends in that body would make inquiries of us and
give us the opportunity of explaining and removing objections;
but to our great surprise and with an unexampled
precipitancy they rejected it at once. This reception
of the last of my official communications to them could
not be unfelt.”<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Senators attempted explanations: Short had been
too long in the diplomatic service or resident abroad;
the diplomatic connections of the United States with
Europe were already too extensive, and rather than
send more ministers those actually abroad should
be recalled; “riveted to the system of unentanglement
with Europe,” the Senate, though sensible of
“the great virtues, the high character, the powerful
influence, and valuable friendship of the Emperor,”
declined the honor of relations with him. Yet these
reasons showed only that the Senate felt as little regard
for Jefferson’s opinions and feelings as for those
of the Czar. The manner of the rejection, even more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
than the rejection itself, proved the willingness of the
President’s oldest friends to inflict what they knew
to be a painful wound on the self-respect of a fallen
leader.</p>

<p>These mortifications, which rapidly followed each
other in the last days of February, were endured by
Jefferson with dignity and in silence. Perhaps senators
would have better understood and might have
more respected a vigorous burst of anger, even at
some cost of dignity, than they did the self-restraint
of the sensitive gentleman who had no longer a wish
but to escape from Washington and seek peace in
the calm of Monticello. He could with only a pang
of mortified pride write his excuses to the Emperor
Alexander and to William Short, and dismiss the
matter forever from his mind. Public annoyances
were for him nearly at an end, and could never recur;
but unfortunately these public trials came upon
him at a moment when his private anxieties were
extreme.</p>

<p>In his style of life as President, Jefferson had indulged
in such easy and liberal expenses as suited
the place he held. Far from showing extravagance,
the White House and its surroundings had in his
time the outward look of a Virginia plantation. The
President was required to pay the expenses of the
house and grounds. In consequence, the grounds
were uncared for, the palings broken or wanting, the
paths undefined, and the place a waste, running imperceptibly
into the barren fields about it. Within,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
the house was as simple as without, after the usual
style of Virginia houses, where the scale was often
extravagant but the details plain. Only in his table
did Jefferson spend an unusual amount of money
with excellent results for his political influence, for
no President ever understood better than Jefferson
the art of entertaining; yet his table cost him no excessive
sums. For the best champagne he paid less
than a dollar a bottle; for the best Bordeaux he paid
a dollar; and the Madeira which was drunk in pipes
at the White House cost between fifty and sixty cents
a bottle. His French cook and cook’s assistant were
paid about four hundred dollars a year. On such a
scale his salary of twenty-five thousand dollars was
equivalent to fully sixty thousand dollars of modern
money; and his accounts showed that for the first
and probably the most expensive year of his Presidency
he spent only $16,800 which could properly be
charged to his public and official character.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> A mode
of life so simple and so easily controlled should in
a village like Washington have left no opening for
arrears of debt; but when Jefferson, about to quit the
White House forever, attempted to settle his accounts,
he discovered that he had exceeded his income. Not
his expenses as President, but his expenses as planter
dragged him down. At first he thought that his
debts would reach seven or eight thousand dollars,
which must be discharged from a private estate hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
exceeding two hundred thousand dollars in value at
the best of times, and rendered almost worthless by
neglect and by the embargo. The sudden demand
for this sum of money, coming at the moment of his
political mortifications, wrung from him cries of genuine
distress such as no public disaster had called out.
He wrote to his commission-merchant entreating him
to borrow the money:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Since I have become sensible of this deficit I have
been under an agony of mortification, and therefore must
solicit as much urgency in the negotiation as the case
will admit. My intervening nights will be almost sleepless,
as nothing could be more distressing to me than to
leave debts here unpaid, if indeed I should be permitted
to depart with them unpaid, of which I am by no means
certain.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Large as it was, this estimate of the debt fell far
short of the reality. The arrears amounted in truth
to twenty thousand dollars.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Nothing but immediate
and rigid economy could restore the loss, and even
with every advantage Jefferson could never hope to
live again upon his old scale without incurring bankruptcy;
he must cease to be a <i>grand seigneur</i>, or drag
his family into the ruin which seemed to be the fate
of every Virginian.</p>

<p>Under the weight of these troubles, public and private,
Jefferson’s longing to escape became intense;
and his letters repeated, in accents more and more
earnest, the single wish that filled his mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall within a few days,” he wrote February 25,<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
“divest myself of the anxieties and the labors with
which I have been oppressed, and retire with inexpressible
delight to my family, my friends, my farms, and
books. There I may indulge at length in that tranquillity
and those pursuits from which I have been divorced
by the character of the times in which I have lived,
and which have forced me into the line of political life
under a sense of duty and against a great and constant
aversion to it.”</p>
</div>

<p>March 2 he wrote to Dupont de Nemours,<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> in
stronger terms of weariness and disgust: “Never
did a prisoner released from his chains feel such relief
as I shall on shaking off the shackles of power.
Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science
by rendering them my supreme delight.” March
4 he rode once more on horseback to the Capitol, and
stood by the side of Madison while John Marshall
administered the oath of office. The weight of administration
was at last removed, but the longing for
home became only the greater. March 5 he wrote
to Armstrong:<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> “Within two or three days I retire
from scenes of difficulty, anxiety, and of contending
passions, to the elysium of domestic affections and
the irresponsible direction of my own affairs.” A
week afterward Jefferson quitted Washington forever.
On horseback, over roads impassable to wheels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
through snow and storm, he hurried back to Monticello
to recover in the quiet of home the peace of
mind he had lost in the disappointments of his
statesmanship. He arrived at Monticello March 15,
and never again passed beyond the bounds of a few
adjacent counties.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief which seemed as sincere and
deep as his own, the Northern people saw him turn
his back on the White House and disappear from the
arena in which he had for sixteen years challenged
every comer. In the Northern States few regrets
were wasted upon his departure, for every mind was
intent on profiting by the overthrow of his system;
but Virginia was still loyal to him, and the citizens
of his own county of Albemarle welcomed with an
affectionate address his final return. His reply, dignified
and full of grateful feeling, seemed intended as
an answer to the attacks of partisan grossness and
a challenge to the judgment of mankind:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The anxieties you express to administer to my happiness
do of themselves confer that happiness; and the
measure will be complete if my endeavors to fulfil my
duties in the several public stations to which I have
been called have obtained for me the approbation of my
country. The part which I have acted on the theatre of
public life has been before them, and to their sentence I
submit it; but the testimony of my native county, of the
individuals who have known me in private life, to my
conduct in its various duties and relations is the more
grateful as proceeding from eye-witnesses and observers,
from triers of the vicinage. Of you, then, my neighbors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
I may ask in the face of the world, ‘Whose ox have I
taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed,
or of whose hand have I received a bribe to
blind mine eyes therewith?’ On your verdict I rest with
conscious security.”</p>
